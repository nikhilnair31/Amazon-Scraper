B08H8S61FY,Jordan Mays,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2022",Beautiful Inspiration of MFK Oud Satin Mood,"This is an absolutely beautiful scent. After watching many reviews on YouTube about Ministry of Oud I finally decided to pull the trigger on Oud Satin. Oud Satin is a fragrance dupe for the popular Maison Francis Kurkdjian Oud Satin Mood Fragrance.

This from beginning to the dry down is absolutely beautiful and extremely similar to the original it‚Äôs inspired by. You will not regret this purchase. Great performance, beautiful scent, and a beautiful bottle for your perfume/cologne stand.

This is also an extrait de Parfum which means it has more oil concentration.

Thank me later!"
B08H8S61FY,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2023","The perfume is great, shipping not so great.",I was suprised when I was notified the item is being shipped by UPS instead of Amazon. That means I missed my parcel 3 times and I had to adjust my schedule so I didn't miss it the forth time. I wouldn't purchase this item again for this reason. The perfume is great.
B08H8S61FY,nonny,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2023",WORTH IT,This smells more like Jo Malone Velvet Rose and OUD than it does MFK. The projection isn‚Äôt quite there but a good scent to have in your collection to layer with something else.

B01ELWU4NU,Raf Hakin,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2023",Great for the right buyer,"First I want to be clear on why I'm giving it 4 stars, this scent is just not for me. Im new to fragrances and still young, but I saw some awesome reviews on this so I made the purchase.

The scent itself is very nice, and great quality. Im not great at being able to tell ""nodes"" apart or identify certain smells, but with this one I smell honey, and tobacco, very strongly. I would say this is an old mans fragrance.

Im prefer colognes like YSL L'homme and Versache Eros, because they semll clean, fresh, and young. I feel like 18.21 smells too old man like and not really my style at this point in life.

That said, if you are an older guy and looking for this kind of scent, this one's probably the best quality on the market. Even though its not my style, I can recognize that it smells very good and performs well."
B01ELWU4NU,matt durkin,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2023",Another Home Run For This Brand,"Love this product ! Great sent that last all day, I will buy again!
Just need the deodorant to complete the bathroom takeover"
B01ELWU4NU,Kaden Verhasselt,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2022",Very sweet yet masculine,"As a tobacco cologne I did wish to smell a lot more. The honey scent at the very beginning of its life is extremely strong! I like the dry down a lot more than the very beginning. I have used Villain from Pete and Pedro and that is more of what I was expecting. Don‚Äôt get me wrong this cologne is amazing! It is not intimidating but give you more of an approachable scent. The villain label from Pete and Pedro has a very Aromac scent that gives off a kick in the face of high quality cigar tobacco throughout the entire life of the cologne. The notes of vanilla in it are immaculate. This has more of a pipe tobacco scent with a strong aroma of honey at the beginning but fades into a nice smooth scent.

Now this would be an every day wear for me if it wasn‚Äôt so expensive. Villan is only a $50 bottle and the scent is more of a fancy event for me but once again since it is so cheap I wear it a lot! This sweet tobacco spirits would be my daily wearer if it wasn‚Äôt a 80-90$$ bottle. Although the opening comes out as a very strong honey aroma. The drydown gives you a very smooth smell of tobacco and I am okay with that. The only recommendation I could make on this cologne would to be reduce the honey and add in some vanilla notes. Other than that, it is a great cologne! Do not be afraid to try it out!"
B01ELWU4NU,Abdulaziz Fitaihi,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023","Nice, but‚Ä¶..Don‚Äôt spray a lot of it or ‚Ä¶.","Not bad if you sprayed a little bit of it, but at the same time, it doesn‚Äôt last for long time and will smell different if you resprayed it after some time on your skin. So basically I can‚Äôt rely on it all the time"
B01ELWU4NU,Big T-Bone,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2023",Love the scent and its long lasting,"I like wearing this when I go out for a night on the town..... Its label says ""Sweet Tobacco"" but its more like a tobacco with strong notes of HONEY...... I will buy this again, its a little pricy but I feel its worth it. The scent does last a long time however.... I still like to carry an atomizer in my pocket and add more while in rest room. Their Body wash (sold in a plastic liquor bottle) has the same scent however their beard balm does not...."
B01ELWU4NU,Optimus Maximus Primus,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2016",Great Quality & The def. Of A Masculine Cologne.,"This scent was Heavy on the Honey and in my opinion for a much older gentleman but thats a little subjective.
However , what is absolute is that this is one of the finest quality fragrances I have ever had the chance to get my nose on.

Just because I feel it doesn't fit my personality or age doesn't mean this isn't a top shelf scent.

I can tell that it was crafted with care like a well tailored suit. It had the right amount of tobacco but for me it was hidden under the honey note which lasted a long time on my skin . Now because of the honey I can see how some women could try to pull this off as a unisex especially if they are outspoken and bold personality type yet, I think this is more of a man scent and I would not recommend for a woman.

It is not a sweet scent like Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille and it is not as harsh like a Havana by Thierry Mugler Havane.

It reminded me of Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanille just not as sweet and this has a dry tabaco scent to it. It also reminds me a little of L'Instant de Guerlain pour Homme Just add tobacco but It is, its on master piece ,the very def. of a masculine cologne ,and I was very impressed I just don't think it was for me but who knows I may give it another try sometime down the line.

If you like these fragrances you will love this.

B01ELWU4NU,Jordan,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",Great smell,Out of the three colognes 1821 makes this one last the longest and is the strongest smell.
B01ELWU4NU,James Braley,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2023",You wont be disapointed,Its a tad harsh on the initial application. After a few minutes you get used to it and your body interacts with the fragrance and it becomes a very appealing cologne. Its the only reason I dont give it an overall 5. But definitely worth the money.
B01ELWU4NU,Tatish 4K,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2022",i'd like to change my review due to intense impression!,"when i received this item and used it for the first time i was not feeling quite good about it and made a quick bad review. after a while i was not going to change it but it was so intense impression i started to like it so much that im gonna change 2 starts to 5 stars. scent is quite strong even when i open the cap of perfume smell spread in the entire room. it amazed me so much , it is even better than many expensive perfumes out there . smell is so strong and pleasant that im gonna buy it again. bottle itself is promising and masculine. i love it very much"
B01ELWU4NU,Weston,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2023",Hands down best scent!,"I absolutely love this scent! I have used their body wash previously, and immediately fell in love. The scent is strong but not overpowering with this cologne, and I have been wearing it all day and can still smell it. New go to cologne going forward!"
B01ELWU4NU,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2017",Perfection on all nines!,"If I could give more than 5 stars I would. I'm more then pleased with this product, but more so pleased with the customer service. Had an issue and they promptly took care of my issue. Their customer service is something other companies should take a look at. They listen to feedback and stand behind their products. What more could you ask for?! As for this product, it lasts ALL day on me! After showering, my wife tells me that she can still smell it or asks if I just put on some cologne. This is coming from someone who is not yet in their 30's, but considers themselves a connoisseur when it comes to things like this. This juice here, is pure quality. And made here in the USA. Not many are nowadays. None that I can think of. As for the scent, I get a good dose of honey upfront and throughout the scent. Nothing too sweet, but just right. This seems to be sitting along with the whiskey note, which I really don't like in fragrances because usually it is too strong, smells of a old man, or just ruins it for me. This, is perfection to me. Everything seems to be in perfect moderation to where it is not too much of anything, but just enough of what is needed. And believe me, a little goes a long way! And now with this being sold directly from the distributor, you don't have to concern yourself with wondering if it's a new batch or an old one. Or if it was properly stored. The bottles have also been revamped for those who may have faced issues with it before. So in conclusion, get it while you can. Good things come and go in life so make sure you take your opportunity when it presents itself!

Thanks!"
B01ELWU4NU,Richard S,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2017","It is awesome, I kept reading the reviews on YouTube and ...","Guys, You nailed it on this Cologne, It is awesome, I kept reading the reviews on YouTube and finally decided I had to hurry up and get a bottle of this for myself, the anticipation waiting for this to arrive was so exciting, just like Christmas all over again, was a bit nervous when it arrived as I know you had a little problem with some leakage in some bottles but I know the response from you was that you had the problem fixed and I was happy to see it is and my bottle was exactly what I was hoping for, the box it came in is definitely a masterpiece and the bottle itself is the same, I am wearing this right now and have had several compliments in the short time I have had it, I carry the bottle in one of the inside coat pockets when I go out so if someone compliments me on it I take it out and show them the bottle and let them try it and at least 3 of my friends just last week said they are getting an order out right away for this awesome mens cologne, I am new to the Cologne collecting hobby and have probably 23 different colognes and this as of now is my top choice, and I have Bleu De Channel-Dolce @ Gabbana the One-TerreD'Hermes and many more that are rated very high by many people but in my opinion 18.21 Man Made Sweet Tobacco Spirits is on the top of my list. Thank You very much for the work all of you put into this beautiful product, you have a lifetime Customer. Richard Sanvick"
B01ELWU4NU,Curtis,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2022",Love the smell,I was introduced to 18.21 cologne by BirchBox a couple years ago. While the scent ‚ÄúSweet Tobacco‚Äù sounds odd it is my favorite smelling cologne so far and smells unique when compared to others. I mostly get compliments on it while occasionally get told that it comes off very musky. My only minor complaint is that I wish it lasted longer but I feel like this is a problem with almost all colognes in my experience. I use this in combination with their body lotion to keep the scent lasting longer. Really like it.
B01ELWU4NU,Arlo,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2017",... I'm going to compare it to three of my favorite colognes currently,"I just received this product and I'm going to compare it to three of my favorite colognes currently.

A) Cigar (Remy Latour)
B) By The Fireplace (Replica)
C) Jazz Club (Replica)

A) Hands down for me, Cigar is incredible. It's masculine, sexy, and very timeless. It's got a tobacco scent to it but in a way that's not obvious. You can wear this during any season but best when it's cooler.

B) By The Fireplace is the most gorgeous smoky sweet scent I've ever come across. It puts Tom Ford Oud, Mugler Havane, etc to shame (they smell absolutely horrendous IMO). It's pricey at $126 for a bottle but well worth it if you want something truly smells smokey and sweet. DEFINITELY a colder weather scent.

C) Jazz Club is an incredible scent that reminds you of leather, Manhattans, and a touch of cigars. Great silage - definitely a winter scent.

So I sprayed 18.21 on me and took note of what I smelled as the time passed by. Initially it's incredibly sweet...overpowering scents of honey and vanilla. As time passed, it turned into a more cigar leaf scent but one that's been dipped in honey or something sweet. It doesn't have earthy tones like Cigar does. As even more time passes by, the scent becomes very tobacco-ish.

Definitely a nice scent but the sweetness still remains and is somewhat overpowering for me. Not what I expected. If the sweetness was toned down a bit...maybe by a half, this would be an excellent scent because it has so many layers as time passes by.

For now I'm not a real fan. But I'll try it a couple of times to see. If it doesn't work out, it's a gift."
B01ELWU4NU,Maher Awad,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2023",Lots of compliments,I get lots of compliments on this cologne
B01ELWU4NU,Ty Fedderman,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2023",Definitely Buy Again,Wife loves it. Gotten numerous compliments from others as well! Just smells like a classy man should smell.
B01ELWU4NU,Robert A.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2022","WATCH OUT FOR ""AUTO RE-ORDER""","Colognes will last for years. Just a mist and you have more than you need.

But BINGO, Somehow I got another bottle sent this week. Amazon is processing a credit for me, but not sure if they have taken steps to stop this auto reorder at 5 months as I now see on original order."
B01ELWU4NU,The 4th letter,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2022",Just Wow!!,"I‚Äôm very, very picky when it comes to the fragrances I buy. I don‚Äôt buy cheap I buy quality and though this is cheaper than I would usually spend it‚Äôs worth as much as it he high dollar fragrances have bought.. this is comparable to Tom Ford‚Äôs Tobacco Vanille scent (which is much much more expensive) I would not put it on par with Tom Ford but this is very close.

B01ELWU4NU,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2023",A little goes a long way,Very strong scent one spray will do the job. I do like the smell of this product and will likely buy it again.
B01ELWU4NU,RJ in Cali,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2017",Nothing like sweet tobacco and booze,"I had only smelled this fragrance as the combination of scents in my grandfather's old-school barber shop. So this was a blind buy for me. It took me back to the old bald barber lathering my grandfather's face and shaving it with the straight razor, which he sharpened on a long leather strap hanging from the side of the barber chair. There is the man smoking a pipe outside the door of the shop. The smell of the shaving cream, the leather strap, the pipe smoke, the talcum powder he would apply with a large brush and the bay rum aftershave...all of that is in this bottle. There is the tobacco, also the bare essence of vanilla or tonka bean under it all. Sweet Tobacco Spirits is a grown up fragrance for men who remember a simpler time. It transports me back there. This scent is distinctive and boozy. I can't smell it after an hour but anyone within 5 feet still can for at least another 4 hours. Love it."
B01ELWU4NU,Jason,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2019",A Gentlemanly Boozy Vanilla Fragrance,"The Scent: I really don‚Äôt get any tobacco here at all. It‚Äôs just a boozy vanilla (probably bourbon vanilla) run amuck. If there was an actual tobacco note this would be one of the greatest frags of all time. Seriously, it would have given D&G‚Äôs The One a run for it‚Äôs money especially since performance is so good. But alas, it falls in the ‚Äòreally good but not great‚Äô category for me.

Performance: The longevity on this is above average and so is projection so go easy on the trigger. Definitely a cool weather scent that leans nighttime but I think you could pull this off in daytime as well, especially on the coldest days of winter.

Presentation: Nothing but love here. The bottle and cap are dead sexy and the atomizer is outstanding. Honestly the atomizer is nearly as good as a Dior atomizer, yeah, that kind of outstanding."
B01ELWU4NU,Doc,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2022",Wife loves the scent!!,"The scent is fantastic, it last a long time and correspondingly it's worth every dime! It goes very well with the mens body wash of the same name. Two thumbs all the way up!!!"
B01ELWU4NU,Technology Instructor,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2021",It is not bad.,"I like 18.21 products. This is a good size bottle for the price. It is kind of a weak effeminate smell compared to their other more manly scented stuff. I get zero compliments at home or at work when I wear it. That is neither bad nor good. When I wear Fahrenheit by Christian Dior, heads turn, but you don't always want to do that as it would lose its effect, or you at least want to mix it up some. This is not a mix it up or a head turn. It smells like you spilled honey on yourself, and is flowery. Not the vanilla, rum, tobacco type scent from 18.21's other products."
B01ELWU4NU,Tony Kim,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2018",Don't be turned off by the sweet smell and don't be afraid to blindly purchase this like I did. :),"Normally one shouldn't blindly buy cologne/perfume, but I took a gamble, seeing as it was recommended and most of the reviews were very favorable. Unlike some other reviewers, my package fortunately did not leak during shipment and I was very surprised as how much fluid was in the bottle. The stock picture truly doesn't do justice as to how big the package is. Anyways, onto the review. It has a very sweet smell like honey but don't be alarmed. The saccharine smell mellows out greatly over the course of the day and has a faint blend of tobacco and honey. I haven't had the chance of others noticing the smell and commenting on it directly, but I did notice some people making extra passes at me when I talked to them. I don't expect to pick up girls or anything like that with using this, but I really do like how the cologne and the intoxicating smell is making me a bit more self-confident in myself. Maybe I'll report an update in a couple months to see how using this affects my daily life."
B01ELWU4NU,Mom of 4,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2017",Expensive smell for thrifty price,"I bought this for my husband as a less-expensive substitute for Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille, which he loves. He likes this just as much, although it is not quite exactly the same scent. It is similar, but with a little bit of a leathery smell added in. At first it smells very spicy and leathery (like a cross between Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille and Spicebomb by Victor &Rolf), but as it wears on and the top notes fade, it turns into a sweeter, rich vanilla scent similar to Calvin Kline's Obsession for men, but not as pungent and musky. It is not something you smell everyday, and my husband prefers a sofisticated, mature, masculine scent like this one. But most importantly....I am a woman and I like it too. It smells great on him. I read reviews that complained about the packaging/bottle/spray pump...our arrived in perfect condition, no leaks, no problems. Great product/ good value"
B01ELWU4NU,Bultaco,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2023",Manly smell and not too strong,Amazing scent. Sweet tobacco flavor is rich and authentic
B01ELWU4NU,Andy MacKellar,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2022",Doesn‚Äôt smell like shampoo,"I rarely write reviews, but I‚Äôm hoping to make the next person think twice about blindly spending $80 on something that sells more like baby powder than the 18.21 shampoo. The shampoo smells amazing. However the cologne is not a match. It has similar notes, but clearly there‚Äôs additional scents added in, which I found to be overwhelming. The overall aroma isn‚Äôt bad, but it‚Äôs strong and to me smells like something an older lady would wear. The scent wears off quickly than my other colognes. Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt able to return this. The good news, at least it didn‚Äôt leak in the box."
B01ELWU4NU,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023",My New favorite,"Good smelling stuff.....mild, masculine, sweet aroma"
B01ELWU4NU,Mike Carr,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2019",Amazing,"I've owned this for about a year now. Worn it a lot. Smells like sweet honey/vanilla pipe tobacco. It's not complicated but still feels sophisticated. This is a performance monster. You will smell this on you in the morning. It is great but not offensive projection. If you like ""Back to Black"" by Killian (some say ""Light My Fire"" by Killian but I do not think they are as similar), this runs in the same circles. It is not a clone, and it isn't nearly as complex, but that lack of complexity is really this fragrances identity.

As soon as the leaves start turning it is time to wear this. Its a warm sensual scent that not a lot of people are wearing. If you are a mad-person you can wear it when its warm outside, but I wouldn't. Price has already increased from when I bought my first two bottles."
B01ELWU4NU,Fred,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2022",Very unique!,"Tired of fancy and expensive cologne. But this one is just so unique. Once you start using it, you‚Äôll never use other cologne. This tops them all. I even use it when I‚Äôm home that‚Äôs how good it is. I‚Äôll never buy other cologne. I like it!"
B01ELWU4NU,AvidConsumer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2022",It's just too sweet,"I don't know why 99% of ""tobacco"" colognes have too much vanilla and cinnamon in them... its way sweeter smelling than the shampoo - which I love.

I picked this up because I love the scent of the shampoo... but this comes off as either too vanilla-ish or too cinnamon spiced. I've had people say I smell ""clean"" and some say that it reminds them of Cinnabar perfume. Not a single person thought it smelled like tobacco or particularly manly.

Maybe it's just my body chemistry, but if you're looking for a tobacco scent, this ain't it.

Overall super disappointed with this for the price to expectations."
B01ELWU4NU,Jennifer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2017",A must have,"The price is high for a reason. It had a smell that is very difficult to find anywhere else. It you went to be the memorable guy who smells great this is the one. I've had women who are complete strangers compliment on the smell of this cologne. Be very careful to not over due it though. I spray it directly on my chest and neck when I get out of the shower just after drying off (yes, that's the secret). Get this cologne in your pores when they're open, that way if you start to perspire it opens your pores and you smell amazing! Two sprays goes a long way gentleman. BTW, the hair paste works awesome and smells the same too. My advice is to apply that when your hair is still just a smidgen wet, run it in good and style and it'll be good to go.

B01ELWU4NU,James Ellsworth,"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2016",Quality Formulation For Men Who Appreciate Fragrances,"The difference to me in 'LOVING' and 'LIKING' a product like this is the lasting value of the fragrance on my skin and its lasting balance of base and fragrances in the bottle. At $80. plus tax and shipping this is probably not an impulse purchase. I own and use other high end, fragrance-enhanced toiletries (and they don't reach this price level) but this one does seem to be worth the price. The 'tobacco leaf' scent lasts a full 24 hours-plus (I wasn't sweating during this test), the product doesn't sting the skin of a normally sensitive (or 'insensitive?') person; and the description of 'sweet' paired with 'tobacco' is 'spot-on.' The 'sweet' notes here remind me of a sugary rum. They fade as the product dries on the skin. My advice: put it on about a half-hour before you aim to impress anyone and things come into a finely appreciated balance."

B01ELWU4NU,Bradicus,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2016","Great fragrance, poor packaging","My rating for the fragrance would be undoubtedly 5 stars.

Manufacturing and quality control 2 stars.

Fragrance is absolutely amazing. Smells like a cross between Killian Back to Black and Tobacco Vanille. Amazing value for money. Very natural, high quality and garners compliments.

First bottle was received with a loose cap and 25% of the juice missing and soaked into packaging. Amazon quickly sent me a replacement bottle and this one was even worse. The sprayer was crooked, a little over half the juice leaked out on arrival. Both boxes were in good shape so leads me to think it may be a manufacturer/quality control issue.

Between the two faulty bottles I've got a little over 100ml, which is enough to last me a while because this stuff performs well. Unfortunately I have to very carefully store upright and can't travel with it. Even a little tip of the bottle leads to a hand/floor full of fragrance. The bathroom smells of this so I think it may be evaporating out of the bottle.

The fragrance is amazing, just wish the bottle was more durable to better facilitate storage, use and travel."

This seems to have pretty good staying power as I have had people ask what I am wearing later in the day 8-10 hours after application.

I decided to dive in for this fragrance that began its life as a $30 fragrance. And shot up to $80 after the demands skyrocketted.
While others might tell you about its boozy quality and all that, it just did not work for me. It was too dense and you drown in it. It was strictly ok.
It does not receive great compliments like Designer/niche fragrances I've worn in similar settings..
Yes it is different but the boozy note makes you a little nauseous. it suppresses/subdues the other notes for me.

Is it just me who feels that way? no... hit reddit and you will find several others trying to get rid of their bottles with the same opinion.

It is a powerful tobacco bourbon scent. You can begin to pick up the best notes about 30min after your sniffer recovers from just 1 spray to chest area.

B01ELWU4NU,Sharon Heidecker,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2016",A must own cologne!,"Omg, do we love this cologne! I bought my husband first the body wash, and we both love it! I try not to use it, as it's his, but he washes me with it when we get the chance to shower together! Such a warm sexy smell, but it's also very luxurious and sudsy! We'd both recommend using it. I ordered the cologne for him for Christmas, and we both also love it, although I don't wear it. We recommend to everyone. Don't hesitate, buy them both and surprise your man!"
B01ELWU4NU,Robert,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2019",So far so good,"Got it, tried it, liked it. Nice cologne, smells good, doesn't last all that long though. Its not overpowering but not real subtle either when it first goes on. Overall a nice fragrance."
B01ELWU4NU,TDP,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2020",Great Product,Scent is just as expected. I purchased the pomade as well so I knew the cologne would be just as good. No complaints . The shipment arrived a day later but honestly after thinking about it? with the weather event we had the last 24 hours it wasn‚Äôt the carriers fault. Great product... great service... Would continue to order
B01ELWU4NU,Doug,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2021",Love the scent,There is something about this scent that is different than all my other colognes. Very unique and have received compliments on the way I smell.
B01ELWU4NU,Rw,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2019",Shop for lesser price.,"I would have given five stars but the price took a star away.

Great fragrance, long lasting, not overpowering.

I hope I can find the same amount at a lesser price, because I would love to have more."
B01ELWU4NU,C. Davis,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2016",Excellent!!,"Without question a true surprise!! Between the combination of tobacco, honey and a variety of other ingredients this most certainly turns heads. In and of itself it flanks Tom Ford - Tobacco Vanille quite easily. Two sprays will suffice for most. Overall, that alone raises this fragrances' worthiness more than anticipated. 18.21 is a new fragrance that many will find to be one of the best to wear. Again, it will turn heads and draw subtle attention to, absolutely!!
Scent - 9/10, Sillage - 8/10, Longevity - 9/10"

B01ELWU4NU,Ilyass oudghiri,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2022",VERY Disappointing!,"I got this cologne for a third time based on my subscription. I was so very upset that not only is the longevity already pretty bad, but this time, the cologne simply came with no good scent. It smelled so bad that it felt like alcohol and gasoline combined. This is very disappointing because I remember the first time I got this cologne. I was so in love with it that I told everyone about how nice the cologne smelled. But not this time. I am canceling my subscription and hopefully, those who read this review won't get fooled or tricked like me."

Amazon. I have been using Perry Ellis 360 for over 20 years. I have to say that it smells the same but it‚Äôs water downed. Meaning it‚Äôs less cologne and more water. I spray it on my neck and ears and it may last than 30 mins if that. Disappointed!!! Do your research and spray a little to see if it last through out the day.

B000P25170,Dominic T. Sedillo,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2021",Worth this cost in smell...,"I've been using this cologne for years. Cologne is very personal and I think it always depends on the taste of the user.

It lasts the entire work day for me. I use it sparingly so I just need it to be apparent when people are close.

For what I paid and the sizes of the bottle I think it is well worth the cost. It will last me for a year or more at least.

This has a potent smell with just a few sprays but it's not overwhelming. It's appealing and masculine.

I HIGHLY recommend."

B002G789QC,Mrs. Chadwick,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on November 24, 2016",,"Many years ago I can remember my late grandmother and my Mum using this, but I could never remember what it was called, but could always remember the still and design of the label.

So when I was looking for a fragrance for a gift the other day, guess what I found out the fragrance I loved as a child was called ‚Äú4711 Original Eau de Cologne Splash‚Äù, so I was really please and decided to treat myself.

It arrived well packed from Amazon, so the bottle was still in one piece. :-)

They still use the same lovely branded boxes that I remember from childhood.

The cologne is in a glass bottle with the branded label on the front. The firm still uses a metal top which is in gold and red and has a red branded label round the lid, (the top was very tight so it took a little time to open it) and the 4711 is on top of the lid.

4711 is a traditional German Eau de Cologne by Maurer & Wirtz which has been around for 222 years, the firm has a large range that also includes deodorant, aftershave and soap. :-)

It uses essential oils and has an aromatheraputic effect.

The top notes are orange oil, peach, basil, bergamot and lemon. Its middle notes are cyclamen, lily, melon, jasmine and bulgarian rose. The base notes are patchouli, tahitian vetiver, musk, sandalwood, oakmoss and cedar.

It‚Äôs a classic and can be used by both women and men.

I can remember as a child when I didn‚Äôt feel well or had trouble sleeping it was always something my late grandmother and Mum used to place on my temples to help relax me.

I still find this relaxing and calming today, (so besides using lavender I can also use this as well)."
B002G789QC,J,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on September 25, 2017",,"I really love the smell of this scent - I'm a fan of citrus scents, and the citrus of this, combined with the bergamot and peach make it truly refreshing. It's also a classic scent, so it might also speak to the memory side of your brain!

This bottle gives a good amount. However, the neck of the bottle is so small that you can pretty much tip it upside down and nothing comes out. Applying it to the skin this way does not therefore give enough scent to last - I feel it stays for a few short hours. I find that decantering into an atomizer makes a difference, as you can spray more onto you over a larger area. The difficulty is that you can't simply pour the liquid from the bottle into the atomizer because the neck is so slim, so I've been siphoning it into the atomizer with an extremely slim straw (which is, unfortunately, shorter than the bottle, so I'm going to have to find another solution once I use up enough to make the remaining liquid unattainable..)."
B002G789QC,Koko E.,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 28, 2020",,"TLDR:

+ Amazing and refreshing scent, perfect for summers.
+ Great as an aftershave or for bed linen.
- Poor performance, but to be fair that's not what this is intended for.

I absolutely love this scent, reminds me of a barber shop for some reason. This is a light and sparkly neroli that's perfect for warmer weather, unfortunately this cologne concentration does not last long on my skin‚ÄîI get 30 minutes to an hour maximum, so I use this almost exclusively as an aftershave. Amazing scent though!

For those complaining, is not an EDT or EDP, it's a cologne splasher so don't expect long lasting performance from it‚Äîthat's not the point. If you want a similar neroli fragrance that lasts a bit longer, check out Tom Ford's Neroli Portofino."

B002G789QC,Emily,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on July 24, 2013",,"I bought a bottle of 4711 after discovering that it was very popular in the 1950s, which is my favourite decade. I highly recommend this product because I think the scent is a delightful, timeless classic. I would, however, try the scent before buying this product because it smells slightly different to what I imagined. I think it smells very citrusy and it has a sort of musty tang to it when it is first applied; the ,longer you leave it on, the nicer the scent becomes. It is strong when you first apply it but then becomes more subtle by the end of the day. This bottle of 4711 is extremely good value-I haven't seen it cheaper anywhere else; it also lasts a long time because I have been using it for months now and I still have lots left! the packaging is wonderful, it has a traditional and grand air to it and looks lovely on my shelf. I highly recommend this product."

One of the things she always had on her dressing table was a bottle of 4711. She would sprinkle drops onto her handkerchief and lightly splash on her face and neck. She always smelt refreshingly attractive. Although I do not use frilled cloth handkerchiefs, I love the crisp and fresh scent of this cologne. I splash this on my face and body after a shower. It gives me an active buzz and I really do feel refreshed. I love it and when using Google it brings back the memories of my grandmother."
B002G789QC,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 14, 2017",,"This is very similar to Tom Ford's gorgeous and very expensive Neroli Portofino. Even the bright blue of the bottle is the same! (And this came first, incidentally)

It doesn't have huge lasting power but the bottle will last for ages so I've found you can be pretty lavish and splash it on to build up the scent with worrying about using it too fast, especially given how cheap it is.

Highly recommend for a fresh clean smell!"

B001RVKJZ2,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2021",Delightful Fragrance,"I have all of the Aqua Colonia Fragrances and find them to be a wonderful change from the heavy blended colognes that all seem to smell overpowering. These are all great on their own, however they are light and easy to layer if you would like to try it. This one should be sprayed first, and it is a lovely fragrance on it's own or with the Mandarin orange or the peach, or lime spritzed on top. They are really fun to have and all smell terrific. This Lychee Mint one does seem to last longer. That's why spraying it first works out better. I have allergies and these all work for me. Also, some of the complaints that say they don't last long has to do with our own sensitivities to fragrance. After a while most of us will naturally adjust to certain fragrances we are wearing and no longer notice it and think its too light, or we need more. However others can really still smell them on us."

It was cheap enough, so I ordered it. Once I smelled it, I tossed it in the trash. I would say the scent is familiar, but not sure from where. The scent is not terrible, but I don't find it pleasant. I smelled my wrist a little while later to see if it would grow on me, and the smell wasn't even there. So not only doesn't it smell great, it doesn't last an hour. I would not recommend buying this unless you have smelled it in person. I was going to see if one of my family members wanted it, but I was actually so confident that nobody would like it that I tossed it."

B001RVKJZ2,MRS. THIBODEAUX,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2020",One of the Oldest Scents to come out of Germany,"Okay, this stuff is one of the oldest perfumes created in Cologne, Germany. Created, I believe, in 1872 and the scent seems that it would be pretty accurate for that time period. It is not, however, a modern scent. Its overpowering and if you're a frequent blind purchaser of perfumes or colognes and are familiar with the scent Natalie, designed by the family of actress Natalie Wood that was murdered in the prime of her amazing acting career. This is not a cologne to wear if you're sensitive to smells. If you just want to have it because of the age of the cologne (not original bottle or packaging) and just to say you have one of the oldest colognes to come out, then this will work for you."

I love the provenance behind the brand and have a very very old bottle of the original, but cannot use it as it brings on the al-mightiest of headaches, but this is a horse of a very different colour.

I've been complimented on it so much since too.
Good price point too. Def will buy it again.

To me its very feminine.

Nb: A week after using it, I have found that if you spray clothing with it, it tends to last. My nightgown still had the scent the following day. So a good 12hrs later, same with my hoody."
B07XTRNJ46,Chris Christopher,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on July 6, 2020",,"This is very simply a beautifully intoxicating and heady jasmine cologne. It takes your mind off straight away to the Mediterranean. No sooner had I shaved and splashed this on than I was a young boy again visiting my grandmother in Cyprus : she used to sit in the evenings by her front door under an arch of jasmine - the smell was absolutely heavenly as every now and again a little jasmine flower would fall off. This cologne is a bottle full of those little flowers. Imagine the sound of cicadas, an old, Byzantine church on the hill side silhouetted by the setting sun, a little taverna just about to get the evening rolling as a couple of cats lie blissfully asleep still on a couple of straw chairs and, like a mysterious ancient Greek god travelling between the shadows and flicker of the eyelid - you smell this jasmine pervading and riding upon every single air current that the evening avails to intoxicate and enchant your
soul. I will be buying this again."

What's lovely about this latest scent, one of several, is it has the distinctive scent but with the added charm of jasmine. It's not overly obvious and is all the better for the subtlety.

B003HLF5L8,flyingscot4,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2022",60 years and counting...,"I have used 4711 for over 60 years. When my TOD in Germany ended I bought the biggest bottle I could find and brought it back with me. At times it had been difficult to find and I used Guerlain L'Imperial when I couldn't find 4711. I don't think that the scent lasts as long as it did years ago (or maybe I just smell like an old man), but the scent has never changed. People do need to understand that Eau du Cologne is not the same as Eau du Toilette, which is twice as expensive and lasts a bit longer, but EDT is much too expensive to use as a splash. 4711 takes that title hands down!"

Life then came along and I'd forgotten all about the cologne until recently a co-worker returned to her native Germany for a visit and brought back some of the tiny, tiny bottles and handed them out to her co-workers. I had been hoarding my bottle, just bringing it out to enjoy it every once in a while, when it occurred to me that I could probably BUY some of it (we couldn't afford it when I was a child). Sure enough, after doing a web search, there was my favorite retailer, Amazon, offering it for sale. I purchased a bottle and have been reveling in it ever since. Even my husband likes the smell and he usually hates perfumes and colognes and is actually allergic to most of them.

B000B63O0Q,flatfourone,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2015",Classic and clean. No staying power.,This has a nice light clean scent. Sort of unisex. Not particularly flowery or musky. Just vaguely so. It's great for warm weather. It's very classic smelling. If classify it as a barber shop type of scent because I think it might appeal to people who have owned Pinaud or those type of scents. My only complaint is the staying power. It really doesn't last more than an hour. You could bathe in it and after a short time it would fade so much that there would only be the slightest trace of it lingering.

My mother, now deceased, wore 4711 all her life so I knew exactly what to expect. And because it's the fragrance I always associated with her, I bought a bottle to evoke her memory. I was very disappointed to discover that the product I received from Amazon is not the same fragrance. Not even close. The label on the bottle and the box it was packaged in seem authentic (or at least a good imitation) but the actual perfume inside is likely a knock-off. Which may explain why the seal was loose. Somewhere along the line, someone slipped in a substitute. It doesn't smell bad, but trust me: This is not the real thing.

The tissues are a bit small and firm but nice quality, somewhat drier than expected as well. I was hoping for something that could really take care of sweat but the tissues don't seem to be made for that. So to carry these around for the summer, is still good, but you'll still want a towel or paper towel if you're in extreme heat. The downside for me though is really how the scent is not that strong and the tissues are a pinch too dry. The scent is a bit musky and citrusy, like cloves in a way. At $7 for 10 of these, I'm not really impressed, but I still like them. These will fit inside of a wallet."

Only drawback is the projection/longevity. It projects for the first hour or so, but after that becomes pretty much a skin scent. Everything else about it is absolutely great. The only actual issue I have is the spraying mechanism of my bottle was actually cracked, so it isn't super smooth when i spray it. Sounds like something is catching on the sprayer.

I took a chance and bought this one. I have given it several tries. The scent lasts maybe a minute and is already faint from the start. You can barely smell it on your skin a couple hours later. I have 24 colognes and this one is the first one which doesn't last at all. If the scent was stronger and lasted maybe even a couple hours i would be fine based on the $38 I paid.

It smells like the knock offs from a flea market. The cellophane wrapper gave the illusion of legitimacy upon first opening it. Then the top came off suspiciously quickly. With usual pump sprays, you have to pump about 3 times and then it comes out. This one came out on the first pump. Then the iconic picture of the Abercrombie torso was actually a sticker on the back! I should‚Äôve read the reviews. As a rule of thumb ‚Ä¶.never buy scents on Amazon."

Again - the scent at the store was what I'm familiar with, however the item that I ordered here was completely different.

I tried the cologne for a day or two, hoping it would work with my body and somehow become the scent that I knew and loved. Unfortunately that did not happen and the scent that was there - wore off quickly. I wanted to love this product so much, however it does not seem to be what I anticipated.

I didn't open it for about a month or two after getting it since my other bottle that I actually bought at the store still had some left. Once I opened it to use it, I noticed the cologne looked weird, like it had water based bubbles. The kind you see in a water bottle when you shake it, but definitely not what you see in a cologne bottle. Once I opened it and tried it, the spray felt like totally water was in the mix. Also, it didn't smell like Fierce, but like 10% of it maybe plus 40% of another cologne, and I'm guessing 50% water since it was so weak. Terrible idea buying it off of this merchant."

B07HWP4WP5,RJazz909,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2023",Deliciousness In A Bottle,"To me, fragrances are an added layer of self expression. You wouldn't know it by looking at me, but I do like weirder and more unique things. Not all the time, but sometimes. This fragrances absolutely fits that bill.

What intrigued me was the ""melon opening."" Boy was I not let down. It is yummy. I practically want to start biting my wrists thinking it's made of melon. If you're wondering what kind of melon it smells like, I'd definitely say it leans more towards cantaloupe. Ripe cantaloupe. Specifically the super soft, uber flavorful cantaloupe that practically melts in your mouth. Now add just a tiny dash of peppery spiciness. Boom there you go.

Now, my biggest grip with this fragrance is that it's amazing opener....is....the opener. I really wish that stuck for a long time. But it doesn't. That opener lasts for a couple/few hours and then it's gone. It also doesn't really project that much when it is ""strong."" So what does the scent evolve into after the melon? Honestly, no clue. It's so subtle I really can't tell. After the first couple/few hours pass, I can't really smell much of anything. Mostly like a hint of melon and spice. But that's really it. Honestly it is a little disappointing.

So what happens if you over spray? Good question. It didn't improve the overall length of the fragrance's life. However, projection definitely got a lot better. Originally I'd say it'd be a 6in-1ft if that. After over spraying it was easily 1ft-1.5ft. And the scent bubble was definitely stronger. But again, the overall life was the same. And even sadder still, I couldn't really get anything else out of the scent. Once it's gone I got the same hint of melon along with a general sweetness. Which was pleasant. But it's also a skin scent.

Is it worth the buy? Maybe. Price is okay in my book. Longevity just sucks. I think that's the biggest crutch. The smell itself is also really unique. If that's important to you, I'd say get it. If you're wondering where the hell you would wear this fragrance, I'd say anywhere really. It'd be a decent office scent if your office is more laid back. It'd be great for the spring or a cool summer's night. A day at the lake. Probably could get away with it at the beach too. If you don't like overpowering your date or if you think you two are going to be snuggling up later, this definitely won't blast them in the face to the point they have a headache. They will be aware that it's there, and they will enjoy it. You might not get a compliment, but they'll subconsciously know it's there and will enjoy it at the very least.

TL;DR: If you wanna smell unique, go for it. If you don't want to overpower your date but still want to wear something fresh and sweet, go for it.

Oh, and I gotta say this is easily my favorite bottle in my small growing collection of fragrances. It's really really nice."

B07HWP4WP5,LV_KYLE702,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","One is not like the other, Fake","One is real and one is fake, if you looked at the pictures and can‚Äôt tell I don‚Äôt blame you but there are a few things that scream knock off. I bought the real from Abercrombie directly, loved the scent and figured if this is real and that much cheaper then I‚Äôm in business. Sadly it‚Äôs not, you get what you pay for. Mine was purchased and shipped from Giftmart, can‚Äôt speech for the other vendors product but based off other reviews of poor longevity I don‚Äôt think it matters and they are all the same.

1) A&F First instinct is sold exclusively online and not at there stores. Why is this a point you ask, why does the 3.4oz have a bar code when is sold exclusively online. The 1.7oz I bought last week from Abercrombieandfitch.com doesn‚Äôt have one and makes sense why it doesn‚Äôt, they don‚Äôt need one for online distribution.

2) I sprayed the 3.4oz Amazon on my left hand and 1.7oz A&F First Instinct on my right. The smell was off at first then kinda matched the authentic after a couple minutes but after like 1-1.5 hours you couldn‚Äôt smell the Amazon clone at all. The Authentic last on my skin for 8-10 hours.

3) The ingredients are out of order, ingredients are labeled from most to least percentage. How would the same cologne have different percentages of ingredients for the same smell. Also the origin is different for the clone

4) Clone states 70% alcohol, authentic doesn‚Äôt. Leads me to believe this is watered down First instinct to make 3.4oz bottles. Which would contribute to horrible, seriously HORRIBLE performance. You need to carry it and reapply 7 times in an 8hr work day just to keep the smell.

So in conclusion; Smell 4 stars; Longevity 1 Star; Price 1 star. You save half buying here then from Abercrombie directly but you are getting a clone with 1/8th the performance so in turn you have to keep using more to get the longevity and end up spending more money buying more when the 1 time purchase of the authentic would still have much more to go! So not a bargain in my eyes. Was hoping for a hidden gem online for a great price and sadly that‚Äôs just not the case. I would not recommend this, you‚Äôre getting $10 Worth of the cologne then the other $30 you are paying for perfumers alcohol and water."
B07HWP4WP5,ianD,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2017",Authentic and smells great!,"First off I'd like to point out that I had the same concern as many others here about the authenticity of the product. And I can confirm that it is legit, at least the one I was sent anyway!! Packaging matched the real deal and everything.
The smell of this cologne is a great summer scent and should be great for multiple occasions. My only complaint and the reason for the four stars instead of 5 is that I wish the scent would be a little stronger for more time. It doesn't fade away after an hour like some other scents. I only put two sprays, one on my right wrist and one on my neck and it'll last for a few hours before getting to the point where you have to get close to smell it. I sort of prefer it that way as I don't want to smell up the whole room! But it could be a tad stronger in my opinion! All in all, a great buy and I would definitely recommend!"
B07HWP4WP5,Herm√®s Trismegistus,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2019",Great.... For About 5 Minutes!,"This colognes smells absolutely amazing! I received SEVERAL compliments while wearing it! It‚Äôs also cheap enough for anybody to afford it too! Speaking of cheap... the reason why it‚Äôs so cheap is because the longevity absolutely sucks! The cologne opens with a fruity smell that drives the ladies crazy! Then it dries down to a fresh, borderline soapy scent that ladies still enjoy and compliment. The problem is, this cologne only lasts about 5 minutes! Maybe even 4 minutes and 36 seconds! You‚Äôll definitely have to carry an atomizer filled with this cologne in order to reapply it over and over throughout the day. Or you can buy Abercrombie & Fitch First Instinct Extreme instead. The extreme version supposedly smells exactly the same, but with better longevity! Great scent, atrocious longevity!"

B07HWP4WP5,Daniel,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2018",Won't waste text on this information as such,"Chances are, you've already read what the note impressions are. You already know about the performance of this release, and you already have an idea of what to expect. Won't waste text on this information as such. If not, and you're casually looking for a gift to someone else or yourself blindly, just know that this stuff is amazing. I own over 150 fragrances from cheapos to the top end of Dior and similar designers. Everything from summer high heat scents to the cozy Christmas bottles. This release from A&F is UNIQUE and high quality. Nothing out there smells quite like it, and you are going to offend absolutely no one with it. Don't miss this one, as it seems a lot of people are sleeping on this one.I'd even recommend stocking up on backups."

I personally did not shop there, as I am a normally sized man. Not scrawny! But, I would have to service these locations and I always liked the scents that they drown ALL of the clothing on their sales floor. The powers that be assessed that this would be a fantastic idea by customers associating the scents with ""The Look"" AF was known for. And it worked! The scent is fresh, vibrant and stood apart from other scents of that time. I own around fifty scents now and figured I'd add this to my growing collection. This is NOT the scent.

B07HWP4WP5,Eeyore,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2018",Decent fragrance for the price,"Simply put: this stuff smells pretty good and lasts pretty long. Is it the most sophisticated scent out there for men? No. It smells a bit synthetic and lacks some of the depth I find in some pricier alternatives from designers like YSL, D&G, or Armani, but that's not a knock on it. It's kind of going for a different, fresh, sharper vibe that matches its blue/gray color. For around thirty some-odd bucks, it's definitely worth taking shot on (in my opinion)."

I just received the scent today, and just after 2 sprays of this horrendous cologne, it made the entire room and myself reek of GASOLINE....YES, GASOLINE!!!! I don't know if this certain supply fell on the ground of the parking lot and they tried to save it by sponging it up with shop towel rags soaked in gas, but it is THE WORST SMELL of a cologne that I have EVER tried, ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!! My wife came in the room after I sprayed it and asked if I stepped in GASOLINE, because THE COLOGNE SMELLS JUST LIKE GASOLINE!!

B000C1VWSG,Marsha,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2014",Mmmmm,"This is an update to the previous review because I've purchased this perfume a couple times since. Two different sizes. One was 1.75 fl. Oz. The other, a more recent order was 3.4. My review is for the perfume not the male cologne. This is my all time favorite. I've ordered this perfume from Amazon several times over 6 or 7 years. Unfortunately this particular fragrance isn't in production anymore so the harder to find the more expensive it gets. The smaller bottle was great, no problems whatsoever. However the more recent order (3.4 oz) came packaged fine, didn't look like it was tampered with in any kind of way and it smells wonderful. The only problem is the scent doesn't last but maybe 30 minutes, so I guess I finally got one of the knock offs that a lot of other reviewers have talked about.üò¢ But when I run out of it I'll probably order another one.üòï

This is my absolute favorite perfume. It's not sold in stores anymore so I was overjoyed when I came across it on Amazon. I am completely satisfied with my order. It came in a timely manner and it smells wonderful. I've read other reviews that complained of a fake, however mine was the real deal."

Since I love the scent back in the day and was happy to see it again in the stores, I bought it. I'm glad I did because it smells so good and the scent is not too pungent. Just one spray and the scent lasted on me for awhile. I could see why someone may not like this as it has a subtle scent and it's not as strong compared to other women's perfume. Overall, great purchase!"

I was nervous to buy it online because of reading reviews that suggested the fragrance could be fake, but I haven't noticed any difference. I bought a bottle from amazon and one from another website and they seem to smell the same. I can't compare them to the scent I used to buy in department stores because I don't have any left, but I'm happy with the scent, and even happier that I can buy it online and not have to find a new spring-summer perfume."

The smell dissappears fast when my last bottle purchased at a department store lasted all day. I went to check out a few department stores and their bottles look the same as my old one.

not your clothing.
If you want the scent to last.

note:
I made sure that I bought from amazon.com over other sellers .

I worry about counterfeits.
if you buy from sellers here on Amazon.

He is very satisfied with the scent as it is not irritating and refreshing and the scent lasts for a long time.
And what impressed us was not only the perfume, but also the way the store staff responded. They always do their best for their customers. We will probably become loyal customers of this store, not just the perfume."
B000E7YK5K,Frank Tuttle,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2023",Makes me smell good. Does NOT render invisibility.,"The pros:

* Makes me smell good.
* Inexpensive, good for daily casual use.
* Decent quantity for the price.
* Nice container.

The cons:

* Does not make me invisible. Even if applied twice a day.
* Has no bat-repelling qualities.
* Fails to attract supermodels from a distance greater than 5 kilometers. Also distances less that 5 kilometers.
* A very poor substitute for diesel fuel.

On the whole, I am very pleased with this product, although I would encourage Armani to work on the invisibility issue."

B000E7YK5K,M. Djuric,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2008",A rarity among fragrances,"Rarely does a product entice me enough in order to write a review for it. I have been using Acqua di Gio for the past 4-5 years, if not longer. As it stands right now, I will not wear another fragrance unless Mr. Armani should stop selling it. However, it seems that AdG is one of the top-selling fragrances, so that should not be a problem for quite a while.

I cannot and will not comment with the ""woodsy"" ""dainty"" ""curry"" or whatever descriptive words other reviewers have used to quantify this particular smell. Until the Internet implements ""Smell-o-Vision"" I don't think it's anybody's business to even attempt to quantify it with those words - you won't smell like the woods (thankfully), nor dainty, nor like curry (thankfully x 2). My advice is to go to the store and try it for yourself.

A lot of the users say ""go buy this for your husband"" or something along those lines. This is not the case - this fragrance is not for all people, nor is any other fragrance universally pleasant-smelling. People have their own distinct odors, and the fragrance that they use will complement their odor either in a positive or negative fashion. I personally smell horribly when I use muskier cologne such as Davidoff. I smell ""eh"" or just ""ok"" if I use Polo Sport - it doesn't really complement my natural smell very nicely... However, with AdG it's another story. This is the one and only fragrance that I've worn and received complements and/or inquiries as to the brand of fragrance. For me it works magically. I certainly hope it works just as nicely for you, but you'll have to experiment to find out.

So that is why I'm keeping it around, and why I'm writing this review. This fragrance is perfect for me. I've tried dozens of other fragrances throughout the years, yet nothing has smelled as good on me. By the way, when you try it out, don't spray it on the little paper tabs they have at stores. Spray it on your wrist (a light, gentle spray) and then rub it in. However, do not smell it just quite yet - let it air out for 10 minutes (go to the socks section or something like that so you get out of the strong-smelling section of the store [fragrance section]). Then take a whiff. Spraying the fragrance on a paper tab will only partially indicate how the fragrance truly smells when sprayed on yourself..."

B000C213ES,JoePro,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2014","A Beautiful, Timeless Scent","This stuff is the real deal, any reviews regarding counterfeit versions are old and before Amazon stepped in and switched their supplier, because what I received in the mail was a scent that gets me complements from everyone, men and women.

Acqua Di Gio gets respect from men and the most appropriate term would be appreciation from women. May this help on a date or in a club? Probably, but it's simply a very pleasant scent almost anyone will enjoy when around it.

It's also very famous and most people I know recognized it by name when they noticed it on me.

If you're looking to be the freshest person in the room, Acqui Di Gio is for you, if you want something unique to keep people guessing, I'd keep searching.

As a side note, some reviews mention that the scent goes away after a while and this indicates a fraudulent product, but anything you spray on yourself, your nose adapts to and I've actually asked when I stopped smelling it if my coworker could, and she could. Only I couldn't smell it, but it was there. Also, if sprayed on clothing, don't expect it to last long, cologne is for the skin, spraying on the warmer parts of your body like the inner elbows, backs of knees, wrists, neck, and chest help your body heat amplify the scent."

B000C213ES,BCMueller,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2013",Great Product,"The best cologne I've ever had. Georgio Armani makes an epoch product here. My wife and I both love the scent and it's long lasting. My only complaint would be the price, but at $90.80 (free shipping), Amazon beats the department stores. I highly recommend it.

I read some of the other reviews on Amazon about people getting fake bottles of perfume and cologne they bought on Amazon. That concerned me, prompting me to do some research. I found out that authentic bottles of cologne and perfume have a serial number engraved in the bottom of the box and a matching serial number on the bottom of the bottle. So look for that. Also, some of the reviewers said the smell wears off in 10 minutes on their ""fake"" bottles. Well, even on legitimate bottles, the smell is going to wear off in 10 minutes because your body's olfactory nerves, the nerves responsible for smell, will send repeated amounts of sensory information to the brain, which then ignores that piece of sensory information due to the repetition of the smell. Instead, if you can't smell the cologne anymore, ask a friend or if you're feeling bold, ask a stranger to smell you and they will be able to smell it. As always, if the price is too good to be true, it probably is. Good luck."
B000C213ES,Elo,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2014",I got the REAL stuff as of March 2014,"Well I have been very hesitant after reading the fake cologne reviews on this cologne, after all spending almost $100 on cologne ain't no joke, so I went ahead and googled fake Acqua Di Gio and the video with most views explained very well what some differences are.

All of the obvious signs such as ""Silver"" (more reflective) letters on the front of the bottle checked out, the CLEAR tube instead of the FAKE white tube inside the bottle checked out.

The smaller sprayer diameter instead of the fake bottles larger diameter checked out, but make sure you don't freak out if you don't have a fake one to compare it to.

And overall the BIGGEST test. I sprayed a total of 2 yes TWO squirts around my neck this morning, right under my turtleneck underarmor shirt, and after a 12 hour shift working in a warehouse i came home and every time i turn my head I can smell the fragrance VERY strongly.

I'm sure most people write these reviews when things go wrong but as of March 2014 i gotta say that my cologne is absolutely legit.

Best of luck to you guys amazon shoppers. Save some money and buy with confidence, amazon is back on track with their quality control.

Love the smell, 5 out of 5!"

Aqua di go has always been my go-to and there is something about this that just isn't right. I can give a better review upon purchasing a bottle from a more reputable distributor. Other than that yes, it smells good. But doesn't last very long and idk, I can't put my finger on it. Maybe I got a bad batch??!, I just don't know, but its not what I'm used too. Now to think about it, this is fake as hell. It is not the same. Dont get taken like I did. I knew something about it was off and I am correct. It doesn't last very long at all, maybe 20 mins before you have to spray a quarter bottle on yourself to mimic the actual smell. Im so furious, I should have kept the packaging and sent this garbage back! I should have known 92 dollars for 6.7floz was to good to be true. Ugh so passed off"
B000C213ES,Jashyir,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2020",Hesitant!,"Upon reading several reviews I was extremely hesitant on ordering this cologne from Amazon seeing that many customers complained of receiving fake products. I ended up biting the bullet ordered the 6.7oz. To prove its authenticity I did a bottle comparison since I have a legit, empty Aqua Di Gio bottle that I had bought from Macy's. I Googled, ""How to spot a fake Aqua Di Gio cologne"". Many results appeared with picture comparisons that helped aid in the confirmation. It turned out the product I received was legit when I compared them. I would strongly advise anyone who plans on purchasing this to have some sort of comparison e.g. empty bottle of this cologne or picture from Google; so that you do not get ripped off."
B000C213ES,Davinia Londregan,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2017",We got a fake.,"Acqua Di Gio is my favorite cologne. I started wearing it back in college about 16 years ago, and I know the scent well. I was excited when my wife got me this bottle as a gift; however I quickly became suspicious of this bottles legitimacy. The scent was a close, but smelled a little off, and it quickly wore off. I went out to a local reputable Acqua Di Gio authorized seller and picked up the same bottle I am reviewing now. After comparing the two bottles and boxes, I have come to realize that I have received a fake. A very good fake, but a fake none the less. Here are the biggest red flags that lead me to this conclusion.

1. I sprayed the bottle I am reviewing now and the bottle I bought at my local retail store on a few test strips. I set the test strips aside for 4 hours, and came back to smell them. The strips from the bottle I am reviewing barely had any scent on them. The strips from the retail store still had a strong Acqua Di Gio scent to them.

2. The box of the Acqua Di Gio I am reviewing is a slightly different shade of white from the box I purchased at the retail store. You can't tell from the picture but it is visible in person.

3. The box purchased at the retail store has a barcode printed directly on the box. The barcode on the box I am reviewing has clearly been tampered with. There is a square cut out of the box where the barcode would be, and a barcode sticker was placed over it. I have included pictures of this. Also, the retail box has dots printed to the left and right of the barcode. The box I am reviewing does not have these dots. These dots are offset far enough away that they should still be visible in the area that was not cut out.

I contacted Amazon and their customer service was outstanding as always. They immediately issued us a refund, and assured us they would check their stock."

Definitely a must have.,"I have to admit, this is a top popular scent which is both a classic, recognizable but hold its own in aquatic scents. It does stand out over most other aquatic scents and it took me a little while before I fully appreciated it because it is very strong for my nose. Now that I have been using it for a while and reduced the number of sprays, I have really started to like this fragrance and it is an awesome, fresh, long lasting aquatic summer scent and I also use it in the office so now and then. The feedback on this fragrance is positive and it is generally liked. Recently I also purchased a small bottle of Acqua Di Gio Profumo which lasts even longer and provides you with a slightly more upscale scent. This scent reminds me of summer and the Mediterranean. A winner."

Very expensive though. Also, fair warning that you can't buy the big bottle for the better value, then think you can pour into smaller bottles that you already have. You can't get the spray nozzle off without damaging the bottle and/or nozzle. I don't care about showing the bottles off though, so I accept that the bottle will break, and just pour into smaller, generic spray bottles."

Amazon has the best price for the big bottle too. The first time I ordered this cologne there weren't any issues at all, however, the second time around, I noticed the smell wasn't the same. It could be because I purchased this during the summer months and where I'm from it can be 100 degrees plus. I'm going to give the company the benefit of the doubt since I know heat can change the chemistry of the smell. It still smells good, but it's just not the same. I will still use it though because the price is great! Plus, it was left on my porch in the scorching heat for about 4 hours before I could get to it."

I received this one within a week or so. When I sprayed first time onto my wrist, I felt something odd. It smelled very differently from that of the the ADG I was used to. After half an hour or so, the top notes vanished and my wrist was left with somewhat acrid odour -- like propanol or methanol.

Next day I called up amazon, the customer service exec. apologized and offered a free replacement. I stupidly agreed to it. The replacement took one more week to reach me. But frankly, it smelled the same.

So, I want you - the reader - to be aware that what I received is a counterfeit perfume. Such fakes looks common. The second time, I called up Amazon and they offered a full refund (which is good). But I wasted an inordinate amount of time and effort (and expectation) in this whole buying exercise. I should have stuck with sephora.com

When I wanted to file a complaint with amazon's customer service, they simply refused to file a complaint against counterfeit perfume. The guy clarified that Amazon.com does not have a process to accept complaints regarding the genuineness of the products they sell. This was in sharp contrast to what the first CSE explained.

Anyway, Amazon may or may not be aware of this (presence of counterfeits in their inventory). I am never buying a perfume from Amazon again. You are warned!

B000C213ES,R_World,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2017",* Counterfeit... Although maybe not as bad as some have expressed... None the less I beleive it to be Counterfeit *,"Let me start by saying that I have purchased Acqua Di Gio from retail stores, 1-2 times a year, for over 10 years. I am however new to the Amazon thing, so I researched this item through multiple sellers and I had read many different reviews ranging from ""Good to Bad"", ""Counterfeit to Not"", ""Happy to Not Happy"", Etc., Etc.
I thought to myself, it is being sold by Amazon & shipped by Amazon so how could it possibly be anything but the ""Real Deal"", well I found what many others have commented on...

After purchasing a 6.7oz bottle, I found that the SKU # on the box had been cut with a small razor blade and a new sticker w/ SKU bar code only was installed over the cut-out in the box, the scent seemed a bit off [not exactly what I am accustomed to], the scent only lasted for a few hours [where as it typically lasts most of the day 10-12 hours easily], the cap on the top of bottle was different [inner part & fitment], and the sticker on the bottom of the bottle didn't match the same set-up or design as the ones on my other bottles that were purchased from retail stores [damn close but not the same].

Bottom line for me is ""If it is too good to be true, it probably is"" comes to mind here... IMO, the smell is ok at best, most people may not be able to tell the difference, but if you regularly purchase from a retail store and wear it often, chances are that you are going to notice the difference as do I.

This is the real deal and only a couple of dollars more than Walmart for the same size. Stays on myself and clothes the next day if it were fake this wouldn't happen and the scent would be totally off, I can also tell by just looking at the bottle if it's fake. If you're not really familiar with a cologne or perfume don't buy it off line. I will buy again if the price doesn't go up!"
B000C213ES,nullity,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2017",Seems legit. Great value!,"Due to all of the negative reviews and reports of knock-off bootleg products, I was a bit nervous with this purchase. I went through with it since Amazon is selling this directly, and I think it was a wise choice.

Product seems genuine. The batch code on the box and bottle matched, and the only ""tampering"" was the barcode on the side having been cut off and covered with a sticker. I've read that the lack of barcode on the side does not necessarily mean the product is fake, just that it was routed/sold through unauthorized channels and can never again be confirmed authentic by the manufacturer.

Tried a little on about 2 hours ago. Still smells good!"
B000C213ES,JeffG,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2016",Real product March 2016,"I've been using Acqua Di Gio for about 5 years now. On March 24th 2016 I bought a 6.7 ounce bottle, sold by Amazon, not reading the reviews before I placed the order. I noticed the mixed reviews after I received the bottle and actually tried to return it just in case it was a fake. Amazon wouldn't let me because of risk of the bottle being damaged in shipment.

I opened the bottle, tested and began using it a few weeks ago.

I'm happy to say I received the real deal. The smell still lingers on my clothing in the hamper days after I wore the clothing, just as I've been used to for the past 5 years."
B000C213ES,Rick,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2016",Product had cut out portion of box underneath taped on barcode?,"Just received this today. It smells the same from what I can tell. The cellophane appeared a little old and possibly opened in the past. My main concern is the barcode on the side of the box once you open the cellophane wrapper. I pulled the sticker on barcode off the package and it was obvious that someone had cut the original barcode or batch # from the box? Not sure why that would be done. I am adding a picture. This was shipped from Amazon and not a 3rd party. I hope it is not counterfeit. Also the 2nd picture is from a website on how to identify fake. My original has a lighter color gray writing on the front, and the on I received from Amazon is darker gray. My main concern is the cut out on the box? Amazon should supply an answer as to why the box would be cut like this and a new barcode placed over what I think was a batch #?. After also looking at how to identify fake product most of the items match, although the lettering is a little darker Gray than the correct product. Again, I am not 100% sure because it smells the same if it will last? I think I will by from a local mall next time and pay the $20.00 more. I am not sure if this is real or fake at this time."

B000C213ES,M. Johnson,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2013","Got a fake as well, buy from a reputable store instead!","I bought the 6.7 ounce bottle a while back from Amazon and something felt off on it. It didn't quite smell the same as my original bottle from a department store at a local mall where I originally tried the fragrance, loved it, and bought a large bottle. That one even came with the extra little kit of items like aftershave and shower gel for not much more cash than Amazon. I decided to ignore my suspicions, though, not wanting to believe it was a fake, and maybe it was my memory that was bad.

I found myself using a lot more however since the smell wasn't as distinct as I remembered and I usually put more on at night since it only lasted a couple hours, so it ran out very quickly. After reading some reviews on here before reordering, I learned that many people were saying that they got fake ones, even those ordered straight from Amazon (like mine)! They suggested doing a test with a reputable store bought one. OK, that's a great idea. So I did.

I got the same size on sale from a reputable department store online, free shipping for LESS than the Amazon price. It came yesterday. I did the test suggested by others, putting the Amazon version on on side of my body, on one arm, and the new one on the other. I did not tell my wife this. 10 hours later, I come home as ask my wife to smell both arms. What do you smell here? Nothing! Here? Nice cologne! The claims in the one star reviews were true.

There you go. Don't buy perfume from Amazon, even Amazon direct. It seems they are reselling fakes at the premium price. Shop around online at the large department stores and get a discount code. Amazon is great when it comes to most items, but with perfumes I can just no longer trust them. They really need to investigate this."

B000C213ES,Matt Strom,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2017","The fragrance is very similar to what I remembered Acqua Di Gio smelling like, though it had been several years since I ...","I have a suspicion that the product that I received was not authentic. Visually, the product seems to have all of the hallmarks of an authentic product: tight cellophane wrapper, quality cardboard box, holographic sticker, embossed batch code on the box which matches the bottle. The atomizer did have a very slight breach on its seal, but otherwise the cap and the bottle looked authentic.

The fragrance is very similar to what I remembered Acqua Di Gio smelling like, though it had been several years since I had last worn it. Perhaps a slight bit spicier and more citrusy. However, what clued me in to it not being authentic is that it gave me a severe headache almost immediately after spraying it on. I went to Macy's to sample a known authentic bottle, and that fragrance did not give me a headache.

The fact that the product (as of Sept 2017) was sold and shipped by Amazon convinced me that the bottle was more likely to be authentic despite the conflicting reviews. It seems as though that is not enough of an endorsement. Amazon has since refunded my purchase and escalated my return to their special review team. I had also seen a similarly priced 6.7 oz bottle on Target.com, so it didn't appear that the price was too good to be true."

B0009MHXPY,OneTaste,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2019","Clean, serene, sublime, pure, high quality scent!","Trying to be a wise consumer, I read every single review for this product. I must admit that there was only one factor that had me on the ropes, that did not fully convince me. I didn't feel comfortable with people describing this scent as ""unisex."" It made me think that the cologne would smell flowery, even subtly feminine and I did not want that at all.

I love scents that smell clean and fresh. Cologne has a powerful way of influencing the mood of the wearer. When you spray after taking a good, cool shower, you feel fresh, revitalized, even just born into this amazing world. Your feeling good raises your frequency, you are in a good mood. People catch that and your cent and mood extend these gifts to them.

Anyway, because the ""unisex"" comments were few, and the history of this product seemed solid, I took the plunge. I am SO GLAD I DID! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! I can totally understand why many reviewers stated that they wear it everyday! It is not overpowering at all. It has a very smooth, clean, pure scent. Almost like something that Nature herself could have concocted. It isn't a scent that would ever give you a headache, or make anyone sitting next to you, uncomfortable.

I even loved how it is packaged! Very unique, different than all other colognes. I love this scent so much that I now want to purchase the soap, aftershave, and even the talcum powder! I am definitely going to keep purchasing this product throughout the remainder of my life. It now makes perfect sense why it has never totally gone off the marker. A definite, TIMELESS masterpiece!

One reviewer said that this was a safe blind purchase. I don't fully agree. I can't really imagine a teenager who is at the dance-club, strip-club phase appreciating this olfactory work of art. This is a scent for a well-refined individual who has gained much wisdom throughout the years. Who has come to know what is good and to appreciate it. Who absolutely LOVES beauty in ALL her breathtaking forms.

Anyway, this is my testimony and I am sticking to it! Enjoy, my friend!"

B0009MHXPY,TheEditor,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2019",Absolutely Authentic,"I originally thought this was fake. I thought I was comparing it to a sample I got directly from Aqua di Parma, but that sample turned out to be of Colonia Pura (the teeny tiny bottle was so small I could not see the ""Pura"" on the itsy weeny label). So they were different and since I knew the sample was authentic, this had to be a fake, not so. It is absolutely authentic and so fresh and clean. I got hold of an authentic bottle and it is exactly the same all through the base notes. So no worries there. This is a very fresh clean scent that in the mid notes turns spicey-leather and more masculine from the opening pure and glorious citrus. It then settles in the base notes to musk sandalwood, maintaining that note of masculinity. I don't consider it unisex at all. Some people might get confused because its a little sweet, soapy, clean with some powder scent in the mid notes. But it is definitely masculine in nature. Light but certainly not feminine. I highly recommend it. It is my signature scent. It's tried and true for over a century. Gets their attention subtly, unlike the overpowering sporty/club scents gentlemen fall for these days. That just telegraphs four miles down the road that you are trying to hide your sweat. This Aqua di Parma instead tells them you're clean and fresh all day. It lasts about 6 hours on me. The base note lasts the longest and is the best. Don't go anywhere for the first 15 minutes because you will smell like a lemon grove. :)"
B0009MHXPY,Jonathan O. Sarte,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2023",Authentic product,"This is the original Acqua di Parma unisex cologne from Milan, Italy, said to have been worn by Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. Some knock-offs have appeared in the online market, but this is the authentic product."
B0009MHXPY,Christian W. Riva,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2015",Review For First Time Buyers,"If you're reading the reviews, you're probably smart about your money. You are probably a little nervous about trying out a new cologne without having tried it on first, or are wondering if this is authentic. I imagine many people perform this type of due diligence when it comes to online shopping, so I'm here to help.

However you landed on this cologne, please consider getting a sample first. The reviews calling it ""old fashioned"" are on to something- this was the preferred cologne in Golden Era Hollywood, attracting both men and women. I only wear this in the Spring and Summer, as it has a heavy initial citrus note, which makes me think of the beach.
It also doesn't wear very heavy, and you many not smell it on you after a few hours. I've heard it said that the best cologne is the kind you can't smell on you for the entirety of the day. I tend to forget I'm wearing anything, and then my temperature rises and I smell it again- very classy.

For those of you wondering if it is real- it is. Amazon has massive vetting processes for vendors. You can read about it if you like; my friend is a vendor so I hear it right from him. Why is this cologne cheaper? I imagine it's likely older stock. That doesn't make this a bad purchase- I wouldn't have bought it if I had any doubts.
Why spend $130 for a new bottle when this one might be just a year older?

B0009MHXPY,Michael,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2020","One of the world‚Äôs perfect scents, but beware expired bottles.","Acqua di Parma is tasteful, subtle, classic, and genderless. It reminds one of a villa garden on the Mediterranean, and dries down to the scent of skin freshly cleansed with Italian soap. I‚Äôve worn it for 20 years.
Persons who want a bold scent that fills an elevator and gets noticed by strangers should choose something else. Perhaps the designer aisle at a discount store will have something they‚Äôll like.
* However, this seller sent me a bottle that is 8 years old. I wondered how they could sell it for >50% off the usual price, and why they would do so. It is authentic, but I discovered this bottle (Batch 2498X) is from 2012! Acqua di Parma and its parent company LVMH certainly don‚Äôt endorse selling or using a bottle this old."
B0009MHXPY,Vinadreamz,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2019",Timeless classic!,"So I've been wanting to try this cologne for quite awhile and finally decided to treat myself to a bottle after deciding to expand my fragrance collection. I figured this was a relatively safe ""blind buy"" since it has been around over 100 years and is considered a classic. I have to admit that I really love this fragrance. First, it has a wonderfully bright and soapy scent coupled with notes of lemon and lavender. Definitely could be worn by either a man or woman. Secondly, it is from Acqua Di Parma, one of the oldest niche fragrance houses so I was able to try a niche frag at a comparatively affordable price point. Finally, it truly is a classic scent that has been worn for generations and still going strong. Wear this and you will feel like you are walking along the beach on a crisp summer day!"

B0009MHXPY,John A.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2019","much more intense fragrance than the original, quite long-lasting probably because it is Uni-sex","I discovered this fragrance more than 25 years ago when it was written up in either the NYT, WSJ, or the FT. This cologne was originally used by men in the `20s and was designed for men to put on a handkerchief which then was inserted in the front pocket of either a sport coat or a suit. This custom went out of style and the fragrance went with it. Some time in the late `80s or early `90s, someone decided to resuscitate the cologne, bought the rights to the name, and maybe even ‚ÄúFragrantiere‚Äù where it was manaufactured. I thought I`d try it but it was much more expensive then than it is now probably due to an initial low ‚Äúrun‚Äù"

B0009MHXPY,Fafafuey,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2014",QUALITY QUALITY QUALITY!!!,"EXCELLENT light fragrance which last ALL DAY.

Remember, everyone's body chemistry is unique, so this fragrance will smell differently on me than it does on you. I first purchased this fragrance 10 years ago on a British Airways flight on a whim, and have worn it pretty much ever since. The spray on this bottle is VERY FINE. Keep in mind you only need about 2 sprays AT THE MOST to give you all day coverage. If you don't know if this fragrance is for you or not, just buy a sample here...

Try it, and if you don't like it, you're only out a few bucks.

Aqua Di Parma is also a unisex fragrance. So it smells good the fairer sex also.

I would most assuredly recommend this fragrance to anyone who wishes a classy scent."
B0009MHXPY,Devin Danz,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2012",Classic Scent,"I had read about Acqua Di Parma online, and I started investigating it a bit.
There aren't too many places around that carry it, so when I found it online,I was
excited to order it and try it out.
From the descriptions of it, I wasn't too sure what to expect, 'notes of citrus' etc.
What I found when I actually tried the cologne was something very unexpected. It's a very
clean scent, almost soap-like and I couldn't stop myself from smelling it and trying to figure out the
different scent layers.
What I discovered was that the longer I spent with the cologne, the more I liked it
and frankly, now I use it as the gold standard when trying other scents. For years I've looked
for a signature scent, something that would just be me and I think I've found it.
Light, fresh and clean."

B0009MHXPY,Agent Cooper,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2020",Great fruity scent but it doesn't last long,The scent is really excellent. A fruity scent that really smells like a lot of other stuff out there to be honest. It doesn't last long at all though. I even spray on a LOT of it and by late morning it's hardly noticeable at all. I'm not sure this is worth the price you pay unless you only care about smelling it for a couple of hours. Otherwise you better carry the bottle with you wherever you go.

B0009MHXPY,DAX24,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2017",Warning! Possible Knock Off Cologne!,"Warning: Possible fake cologne! I have enjoyed this cologne for many years. The better stories like Nordstrom, Saks, and Neiman Marcus have carried this higher end cologne and know their source. The original cologne is made in Milan, Italy. After receiving my recent purchase which was somewhat cheaper than the store price, I was excited about this 3.4oz travel size bottle. However, after using this cologne and comparing the fragrance with a larger bottle from Nordstrom, I am convinced that this is a knock off. The packaging, label, bottle, are exactly like the original but the fragrance is not. Since it came from overseas in an unmarked box, I suspect this was produced in another country. Amazon should launch an investigation into this seller to determine where they operate and source their products. A number of other customers have lodged similar complaints or concerns."

It turned into a skin scent after about two hours. Still, I think it‚Äôs a beautiful scent and I would definitely recommend it. You can find this for less in stores though. Usually $10.

B00BF27PGY,Mo T,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2020",Skin Scent for me,"Packaging: I like the clean packaging and the bottle is pretty and understated.
Color: Bourbon tone ( unexpected and makes me question authenticity. The photos I have seen show this is a lighter brown tone. The bottle I received is a very deep tone).

This was a blind buy and it was reported to be a spicy floral with vanilla undertones, that is not what I am smelling. At first spray, I get a clean scent with a musky undertone but it dries powdery. I think powdery scents read matronly to me and that is why many are saying they do not like this as young women. However, its cast is not far and I think it could be a good layering fragrance for me to add more femininity to some other scents I wear as a tend to gravitate towards colognes and unisex fragrances. Update: this fragrance I have to spray directly on my skin. It leaves a nice powdery musk that I find intoxicating. I love wearing it to bed or just lounging."

B00BF27PGY,Zondra Stone,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2020",Deliciously woodsy...,"Wow, what to say!
If you love sandalwood then you will love this!!! It opens with a warm citrusy spice and mellows out to a woodsy vanilla sandalwood benzoin. Yet isn‚Äôt stuffy like other woody scents can be. And it‚Äôs also intermingled with saffron, marigolds, rose petals and jasmine that I can‚Äôt smell individually but mingled together give this an undercurrent of creamy florals as it drys down.
I would say this is a sophisticated scent, simple yet sophisticated. Simple in that it starts, ends and lingers as a warm creamy sandalwood where as some perfumes start off super sweet then become fruity and finally settle into a caramelly warm scent. This fragrance stays true to itself from start to finish. It lasts all day. I get whiffs of it through out my day and it makes me smile.
The bottle and packaging are of simple design. I actually really like the box. The bottle is clear and tall to show off the delicious amber colored liquid inside. It‚Äôs heavy in the hand. The lid stays on snuggly.
I like to layer fragrances. This layers well with any vanilla fragrance or body spray, also with lemon. I have a lemon meringue body spray that I layer under this and it smells absolutely DIVINE!!!
If you enjoy warm woodsy amber scents then go ahead and get it!!
Update!
I love it so much I bought 2 more as back up lol"
B00BF27PGY,jamie,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2023",Complex and Beautiful Smell...,"Concerned when I saw the Marigold and Jasmine Notes in the ingredients listed. However, I am a Levine believer now...the marigold note adds this bright top note that just, to me, adds complexity and sparkle and is surprising with the sandlewood...it is a really well-balanced perfume. This is definitely not your Pink Sugar...it smells pricey and for a woman who is more discerning.
Just wanted to add that it is original in packaging, and the price was really unbeatable."
B00BF27PGY,N. Friend,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2020",YUMMY,"Oh my gosh. What an AMAZING $13 fragrance buy. This smells SO much classier than the price tag, or celebrity ""creator,"" implies.

Sandalwood-lover's dream right here.

Official notes are as follows:
Top notes are saffron, citruses, marigold and spices
Middle notes are Indian jasmine, Australian sandalwood and rose petals
Base notes are benzoin and vanilla.

I'm not a talented ""nose"" when it comes to fragrances. I can't detect really any of the notes mentioned other than sandalwood upon first spray. Nor did I realize I like sandalwood this much. When I sniff my arm, I can detect florals (rose and jasmine). I can't wait for the drydown! The opening is lovely and elegant. I could see how many people think this fragrance screams older woman, but I don't think so at all. I'm in my mid-30s and am LOVING this. If you like warm, cozy fragrances with a touch of elegance and mystique, you'll like this.

I haven't directly smelled benzoin before, but I've read this is a component that turns many people off. Its possible this will ""turn"" on me once it settles on the skin, but I'll update my review if that's the case.

I'd say this is a better fall/winter/cooler temp/evening fragrance. Will that stop me from wearing it in the late hot KY summer? Nope!

Too long, didn't read: Recommended if you like more sultry, woodsy/warm scents. Fabulous value for the price!"

B00BF27PGY,QuoterGal,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2014",Surprisingly delicious,"I love this fragrance - to me it smells like a combination of delightfully-aged scotch and a lush aromatic spiced wood bowl filled with citrus-flavored marigolds. A friend gave me a sample & and after wearing the sample for a day, I ordered it. So glad I did. I generally prefer more herbal/green scents, but this does it for me: fresh, not cloying, rich and warm without being over-powering.

Until I received my bottle & decided to read more about it, I had no idea who Adam Levine was (Maroon 5) or that this was a celebrity fragrance. (I think I assumed Adam Levine was The Nose, or some designer I'd never heard of.) That speaks volumes, because with the exception of Sarah Jessica Parker's line and a few others, my reaction to the Celebrity Craze has been negative: they mostly seem overly-sweet and candy-assed. Ew.

I'm not someone who thinks fragrance has gender - I'm female, but I couldn't care less if a perfume is intended for females or males. I've read some reviews of this fragrance that complain that it's too ""manly"", and while I'm not altogether convinced that phrase has much meaning, this certainly doesn't smell like a men's club, or Old Spice, or leather, or whatever you may associate with a men's cologne. It's just a well-balanced rich hit of lush, earthy freshness. Unique. I hope it never gets pulled out of production (as have so many other smells I've loved) because I intend to keep this in my regular winter scent rotation."

B00BF27PGY,Athena Stafford,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2014",I like to be thorough.,"This is by far the best perfume I've ever smelled. I bought it because I love Adam Levine, thinking it would smell like any other perfume, but I wanted to support him. But then I got it in the mail and 100% honesty-- unbiased (sorry Britney Spears, I love you but yours smelled like alcoholic bubblegum) this is amazing. I've had it for... I think a little over a month now, and I use it every day. Every single person in my family has told me that I smell amazing and wanted to know what it is. I even let my sister borrow it. It doesn't smell like your average cheap floral perfume. It smells sophisticated and mature, but also young and free at the same time... Woodsy but sweet. I can't describe it. But I definitely recommend it to anybody who's on the fence. The bottle is so beautiful, too. Even the cardboard box it comes in is classy. The bottle is clear, the cap is styled like a vintage microphone and the perfume itself is a light pink with a warm tint. And it lasts quite a few hours for me. But it's easy to throw in the car for easy reapply.
Bottom line-- GET THIS. It's the best yet."

When you want to smell seductive but clean this perfume delivers that perfectly! The saffron, spices, Indian Jasmine, marigold, sandalwood, rose, and vanilla pair in a very well balanced accord that doesn't yield too ""musky"" as one might think would happen with so many florals at play. Adam Levine For Her is a more warm than strong scent which I love! It's a really good scent for any occasion and one that I feel you'd find yourself wanting to wear every day. The first day that I wore it I reapplied it throughout the day and kept falling in love over and over again. Given that the longevity of this fragrance isn't stellar it's okay for you to reapply it without fear of smelling too strong / overpowering. I'm definitely going to snag another bottle!!!"

It has a woodsy yet spicy scent that lasts for a very long time. Whether or not it smells the same throughout the day depends on your skin. Everyone's skin chemistry is different...

In fact, if applied on paper and the scent settles in...it smells a bit sweeter and less spicy. On MY skin, it doesn't smell as sweet afterwards which is exactly what I want from a fragrance. A lot of other celebrity fragrances have a sweet, floral, or fruity smell to it but this smells like pure quality. It can be worn both during the day and at night. I love how versatile this is and I am so happy I took the chance and bought it without testing it out first.

The perfume personally smells great all day on my and I really can't compare it to any other scents, it's definitely unique."

I don't like strong perfumes, and it seems like most celebrity fragrances are strong enough to knock you down -- but this one is very light and not overpowering. You have to be very close to smell it. On me, the strongest notes are vanilla and sandalwood.

While this perfume smells amazing on me, it's important to note that individual skin chemistry has a powerful effect on how a perfume smells, so it's a good idea to try it on (and leave it on for a few hours) before making a decision on whether or not you like it."

It has such a strong baby-powder smell, and when you combine that with a musty flower smell, it really doesn‚Äôt work. The reviews that mention citrus or grapefruit scents baffle me. The reviews that state that it smells like old ladies are dead on. Seriously. If you enjoy smelling like musty dollar-store potpourri, go for it.

It‚Äôs like nature has hit me but with sweetness. My favorite scent was Happy AF because I feel like it smelled the freshest and cleanest out of the bunch. I could also smell it on my mom from a distance away unlike the other scents. Hyped AF smelled like a mandarin that was a bit toned down and it still had a light scent. It couldn‚Äôt be smelled unless I shoved my arm into someone‚Äôs face and I found that a bit unfortunate. Chill AF smelled sweet but really was the best in capturing a woody scent out of all the perfumes in the box. It had that small spicy smell to it. It was a great blend that captured lots of sweetness but maintained the spicy side. The smell of the scents didn‚Äôt last long and I probably wouldn‚Äôt purchase them because of how light they were. I like wearing things for other people to take notice of the smell and enjoy the smell of it with me. I also felt like the sprayer could‚Äôve been better. It was much too liquid-like and didn‚Äôt have much of a mist when coming out onto the skin. There was a few times the liquid would run down my arm because of how watery it was.

They all have a musky note to them but Hyped AF has a citrus scent, Happy AF is more floral, and Chill AF is more herbal like. My personal favorite is Hyped, it‚Äôs fresh, citrus, and fruity."
B0BQF23K6V,Nothn4me,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2023",Clean Light Orange-Citrus Scent,"I tend to like light, fresh scents when it comes to perfume and I like this fragrance.

This perfume has a clean, orange-citrus scent that is light. It is described as ""woodsy citrus"" and truly does have a nice balance (not overly citrus-like). It isn't harsh and I was able to apply immediately after a shower (pores open and no stinging, etc.). The scent lasts for hours, but does fade by the end of an 8-hr day.

The bottle is a simple orange abstract shape that really aligns with the fragrance it holds (simple, not overpowering, with a hint of orange). The spray is even and application is sufficient.

I believe it is a good value for the price. It is more expensive than a body spray, but less expensive than a designer fragrance and that is fitting."

This is just a tester set. Each of the fragrances are .05 ounces. I like that the testers are the spray type. However, when I sprayed, I didn‚Äôt always get a mist. Sometimes, I just got drops of fragrance. So spray carefully.

HYPED - I really like the Hyped scent. It was my favorite of all three. This scent has very strong citrus notes which I love. [Listed as ‚Äúmandarin, nectarine blossom, clean musk.‚Äù]

HAPPY - was a little more floral. [Listed as ‚Äúrose, pink lychee, crystalized musk.‚Äù]

CHILL - was definitely a lemon with strong musky. [Listed as ‚Äúred lemongrass, lily of the valley, milky musk.‚Äù]

Lacking in Other Respects.,"I only marginally know who Addison Rae is, but I can definitively say I am not the target market for wearing this perfume. However, I enjoy new scents and have a fear of smelling like an old woman (brought on by my grandma, who wore the same stinky awful scent for years), so I decided to try this out.

This scent is very light and refreshing. It stays on for a bit, but it could certainly last longer. It needs to be reapplied throughout the day.

The bottle is cute, though a bit gimmicky (anyone remember Hypercolor from the early 90s?).

And though I'm not the target market for wearing this, I am certainly (as a middle-aged suburban mom) the target market for purchasing an item like this as a gift for a young woman. When considering the perfume from this aspect, I would point out that though I personally have a mouth like a trucker, it's a little tacky to have the ""AF"" in the name. If I were considering perfume as a gift for a teen girl, I'd probably go with something a little more classic."

B0BQF23K6V,Megan LeAnn,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2023",Chill AF by Addison Rae,"This bottle is really cute and has mood print impression on the bottle. As good as the scent smells it's a bit girly scented like for someone young. The scent isn't as strong but fruity and light. Smells like apples, pears and flowers. The scent is long lasting. The Addison Rae collection has other scents."
B0BQF23K6V,Laura,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2023",Would make a good stocking Stuffer,"This would make a cute stocking stuffer and would give someone a chance to try three different perfumes. The samples are quite small but I do really like two of the perfumes. The chill af perfume is very musky and mysterious but still smells youthful. The hyped af smells florally and sweet and is definitely my favorite. The happy af perfume has a very strong citrusy smell which I do not like, literally smells like you are wearing oranges, not for me at all."
B0BQF23K6V,KC,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023","Nice, light citrus scent","I tried this by spraying it on my arm and then periodically sniffing it through the day. It is a light, pleasant citrus type smell. You can definitely smell the mandarin/orange scent, but there is more to it than that too. It is a fairly light scent and wasn't overpowering to me and also didn't give me an instant headache, which is a huge plus because some perfumes bother me, but so far, this one hasn't. I didn't notice the scent as time went by, but if I sniffed my arm, the scent was still there. It is pleasant, though maybe not my personal favorite. I think most people who like an orange-type citrus scent will like it and it would make a nice gift."
B0BQF23K6V,Saturnalia,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Super Citrus Scent But Wears Off Quickly,"I absolutely love trying new fragrances and this sounded perfect for summer. The bottle is super cool. It's completely yellow because it was really hot but it's hyper color like the shirts from the 90's and changes colors from dark orange to yellow when you hold it. It's not alcohol based so when you spritz it comes out in a stream instead of a mist. It does leave some oily residue behind. When you first spray the perfume you get hit strongly with the smell of the blood orange and nectarine. It's very, very orangey but that super strong citrus smell wears off quickly and leaves a light, pleasant orange and lemon smell. I was really hoping once the top notes wore off I would be left with the low, woodsy notes mentioned but I didn't smell any. After an hour I could barely smell it on my wrist. I will still use this for a fun, summer fragrance but it's not a fragrance I would purchase again. If you love the scent of strong, orange perfume this would be perfect for you but it's too one note for me. I prefer more complex fragrances that last longer than an hour."
B0BQF23K6V,Jillian Schreck,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Color changing bottle,"I love this cute compact perfume bottle. The color changes with heat from your fingers which is a fun added bonus. The scent is very good, very musky but still tangerine. I didn‚Äôt think I would like it but it is very refreshing. My biggest complaint is that the smell just doesn‚Äôt seem to stick on me for some reason‚Ä¶I can smell it when I put it on but not much after at times. It is a very beautiful but faint smell. I appreciate the vibrancy of the packaging it is very suitable for the scent, two contrasting scents mixed but in a good way!"
B0BQF23K6V,Unik,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Smells like pears üçê,"This is a very fruity fragrance that smells like a bowl of sweet candy. It‚Äôs very fruity/sweet but you can still grasp the floral aroma (although not as dominate). This comes off as a younger woman‚Äôs fragrance that would typical gravitate towards ‚Äútrendy‚Äù scents in similar price ranges.

The bottle design is very nice, better than a lot of others in this price range. It‚Äôs a matte bottle and cap that easily snaps open/close. I really like the bottle and it‚Äôs color design (maybe more than the fragrance itself). The fragrance overall is good, not a bad fragrance at all. It's too fruity for my preference but a lovely giftable item for the right person."
B0BQF23K6V,K. Peterson,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2023",Smell Delicious,"My bottle arrived yesterday and two things seemed wonderful, the spicy perfume and the color changing bottle (it arrived a bright pink and was soon blueish purple).
The scent is redolent of flowers with a delightful undertone of musky patchouli. I love spicy perfumes, not to sweet or flowery and not like the deep woods. This one is the perfect blend and does, indeed, spark a good mood.
If you are a sporty type who enjoys the outdoors and long walks in the woods or along a raging river you will love this fragrance."

B0BQF23K6V,N. J. LACROSS,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023","Soapy, clean and a bit juvenile.","This fragrance smells very youthful, soapy and inoffensive.
The presentation is overall rather cheap looking, with the bottle changing colors related to heat, which is the kind of gimmick I expect to be aimed towards a younger crowd.

I really liked the scent, it did stick around for a good 4-6 hours but it doesn't project super heavy or anything.

I could recommend this as a younger girls fragrance."
B0BQF23K6V,Rnk,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Decent Ladies EDP,"Good edp for girls since its bit on sweeter smelling. It lasts around 4-6 hours, depending on your skin type it can vary. I think its bit on expensive side as well. Not disappointed but not very much happy with scent."

It has a refreshing scented fruity smell, which is not. I rarely use perfume in general, but I like this fragrance, and the bottle is changing color according to temperature."
B0BQF23K6V,Stephanie C,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2023",Nice smell but,"The scent itself is not bad, that was one thing about this perfume i actually liked! But the bottle looks and feels pretty cheap, not to mention the scent doesn't last very long on the skin. Honesty, this acts more like a body spray than a perfume and I think the price should reflect that."
B0BQF23K6V,John Greybeard,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023","Leaves a sticky residue on your skin, and it smells like orange juice","I don't know if I got a bad batch or not, but this stuff is horrible. It smells way too citrusy, and it leaves your skin feeling sticky. I'm starting to think they put orange juice in this stuff with as sticky as it is. The smell it leaves after it sits a while isn't so bad, but my wife had to wash her arms because of how it felt on her skin. I consider myself a perfume/cologne connoisseur, and we've had everything from budget brands at the dollar store to brands as expensive as Creed, so I'd classify this as a something you'd probably buy at Walmart for a teenage girl. I did want to give this at least 3 stars, because it does have a unique smell after sitting for a while. but it's definitely not a perfume for a 37 year old woman. If it weren't so sticky I'd have bumped it up to 4 stars. As far as my recommendations for improvements, I'd drop the price to about $20 and label it for teenagers, then get the formula fixed so it isn't so sticky."
B0BQF23K6V,cvcduty,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2023",Pleasant scent,"This is a nice perfume.
I gave it to my wife and I must say that I find the scent pleasant.

The bottle seems neat as well.
Overall, happy with this product."
B0BQF23K6V,Jonathan C,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2023",Orange cream soda,"The scent is orange essential oil with a hint of lemon mint and cream soda. It is delicious and smells natural.

The ingredients list is short which suggests Addison made an effort to reduce toxic chemicals typical in almost all conventional perfumes.

For an EDP, it doesn't last very long. When your primary fragrance is essential oils, the scent only lasts a couple of hours at most.

My daughter absolutely loves it."
B0BQF23K6V,Tom,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023","nice and fresh, but doesn't last long","This smells citrucy and fresh in the beginning, but due to the lack of heavy bottom notes, the effect doesn't last long. Citrucy top notes evaporate within 2-3 hours, and this is no different for this perfume. This is somewhat of a disappointment for a perfume, but also expected from its composition with plenty of citrucy top notes.
Also, about 15-20 minutes after the application, there is a distinct take over of lemon, which unfortunately makes it transiently smell a bit like 'lemon-fresh' scents of various household products."
B0BQF23K6V,Ma'ama,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Sweet floral and fruity fragrance for older kids and teens.,This has a fruity floral fragrance that smells sweet and youthful. I like how the bottle changes from purple to pink when I touch it. This fragrance doesn‚Äôt last all day and needs to be reapplied to keep the scent going. This is most suitable for preteens and teens. My 8 year old daughter loves this scent.
B0BQF23K6V,Miss Pink Lemonade,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Little Samples that Help You Determine if You Would Like the Full-Size Version ...,"These three samples are the type you might get with a purchase at a cosmetics/fragrance counter or even at a cosmetics/fragrance shop. The vials are typical sample size and instead of a mist, it comes out as a fast stream (so go easy here).

Sure, it's a little gimmicky, but there is some silly fun here as well. ""Hyped"" is an overall good scent: it's a little like Tocca Stella, but a little less nuanced and layered. Now, ""Happy"" is genuinely cheery. There almost seem to be sugary notes here. It's a more layered scent that translates as simple and pretty. And ""Chill"" is a little basic but in a good way. The Lilly of the Valley really sings here. All fragrances have musk as their base (or ""bottom"" note).

Since these fragrances are not sold in my area, this was a good way to sample them to see if I wished to order the full-sized versions."
B0BQF23K6V,ThePlainOldT,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023","Very understated, but ""pretty"" fragrances.","This Addison Rae Fragrance by Addison Rae Fragrance is a nicely packaged set of three sample size fragrances. I'm not that fond of the names, but each one smells very much of the notes listed.
My favorites are Chill and Hyped. Happy is floral, which is okay, but florals are not my favorites. All of the fragrances are very understated, but ""pretty"" smelling. I have to put my nose right up to my wrists to smell them.
This sampler set is a nice way to pick your new favorite perfume from this brand, and I would recommend it."
B0BQF23K6V,Carrie,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023",Scent doesn‚Äôt last long,"This perfume is very tangerine/citrusy smelling. It‚Äôs nice, but I was hoping for more of the woody scent in the description. It didn‚Äôt seem to last very long."

Love!! -wife‚Äôs review"
B0BQF23K6V,OptimusPrime,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023",Accurately named,"Happy AF is very appropriately named. When I spray it on I get an immediate mood lift. The bottle is so unique and quirky as it changes colors with the heat of your hands. The scent is a fun, fruity floral that is so uplifting and beautiful.

I generally don't wear any because I have kids that have asthma and a lot of strong smells interfere with it but I can put this one on and go right by them and it don't bother them at all!! That's a big bonus in my book!!!! It has a light scent to it just with one squirt. I'm sure it would be stronger with more but that is all I need."
B0BQF23K6V,mama Ruggles,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023","Nice scent, poor delivery"," The smell of this is light, I definitely feel like it's a younger scent, but I would be comfortable wearing it as an older person too.

B0BQF23K6V,C. Cowles,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Cute sampler,"This comes as a set of three tiny spray samples to test out the three fragrances by Addison Rae. All three smell good. I just wish they lasted longer as they start to fade after a couple hours and I prefer perfumes with longevity.

B0BQF23K6V,Just some person,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023",Happy scent in a unique bottle,"I love the smell. It's not too weak and also not overpowering. I spray it on my clothes and it has decent staying power throughout the day.
I forget what the fragrance notes are ""supposed"" to be, but my personal interpretation after just spraying a few minutes ago is citrus, grape, and rose.
Also I have to mention the very interesting bottle. I love it. It's an odd pebble shape covered with a heat-sensitive color changing paint. It's very creative and a joy to the senses.
Overall, I definitely recommend this fragrance if you like bright joyful scents and very unique packaging."
B0BQF23K6V,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023",a new favorite?,"I got the hyped and chill AF perfumes
Both smell awesome! The hyped is an orange citrus clean scent that just smells like summer in a bottle. The chill is a light floral sandalwood beach smell, both scents are light and not over powering and smell great! They last a good while too. The bottles are also interesting and different, they are VIBRANT, and they change color to touch.
Would be a great gift for a teenager or young adult"
B0BQF23K6V,Fashionista Gal,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023",Beautiful fun HAPPY perfume! No alcohol formula makes it spectacular!,"This is delicious and fun as a perfume. I love light citrus florals so this is spot on. I smelled it and said it reminded me of the Happy we know from that cosmetic line, but this is more complex, not a straight citrus but mixed delightfully with rose, peony, and other complimentary ingredients. I love that there is no alcohol and it is a water based product. There is no alcohol tone to the fragrance, with the bright notes popping first. I feel the fragrance lasts a long time, and, at first I did t think one squirt was enough, and added another, and I think it takes a minute for the perfume to hit the skin and start to offer more aroma.

The bottle is really unique too. It changes colors with the heat from touch. My photo doesn‚Äôt show very well, as I‚Äôm in an air conditioned room but this bottle will turn pink if held for long. It‚Äôs fun and I will enjoy putting it out on my dresser. I don‚Äôt often buy perfume, and this feels like a department store line. It‚Äôs certainly impressing me more than most fancy ones. The lack of alcohol as the carrier ingredient makes a huge difference, and the fragrance is sooo much better for it.

This would make a perfect gift, it‚Äôs a lot of fun, and smells good enough I‚Äôll remember to wear it !!! Recommend!!!! Love love it."
B0BQF23K6V,Bob & Claire,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2023",Flowery Citrus Scent in a Color Changing Bottle,"First off, the bottle is cool. Reminds me to a mood ring in that the bottle changes based on temperature. I feel that is a nice added touch. The fragrance itself is a fruity floral light scent. The scent lasted for about 4 to 6 hours which is good to get through the day."
B0BQF23K6V,B Harvey,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2023",Smells great on women in my opinion,"I got this for a woman in my life and she loves to wear it. I think it smells great, but I don't know enough about scents to know how to describe it. I guess the main thing I think of when I smell it is clean, it smells like someone just got out of a nice bath with scented oils in it or something to me.

The bottle it's in is cool, it changes colors where it heats up, so basically when you're holding it your fingers can change its colors. The way it's packaged makes it a great gift, too. All in all this is a good buy and for the price you get a great scent in a bottle that is very cool to see on the shelf."
B0BQF23K6V,Just my 2 sense of things,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2023",nice Citrus note,at first wife was not a fan I liked it tho sweet Citrus but as soon as she spray it on her body it changes and she loved it it's Long lasting too after a long day I can Still smell it on her very well
B0BQF23K6V,Patricia Evans,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Surprisingly light,"Several interesting things - it smells great first of all.
It reminds me more of essential oils put together in the just right blend. They feel is like that too - so I'll say that if you put on a lot, you'll feel a teeny bit of oil residue on the skin. But it takes a lot. Some of that is because it has good ingredients.
Next was even with adding more it smelled even better but didn't overwhelm my senses - didn't give me a headache like some perfumes can.
And it smelled different at different points - at first you could smell some of the spicy and some of the bergamot notes, then it shifts to lighter more floral with the lily of the valley and pear blossom.
I really enjoy the scent and found myself delighted in wearing it.
Last thing - the top of the bottle - is heat sensitive. So I couldn't help myself and tried to make patterns just holding it. Neat addition to an already nice product."
B0BQF23K6V,Dawn Wenner,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2023",Memorable scent,"First thing is the bottle. It is just fun no matter what your age. Every time you touch it, it is a different color. But the smell is fabulous and doesn‚Äôt smell like just another strong perfume. I do not like floral scent of any kind but this doesn‚Äôt give that to me. I am not good at identifying different notes and know that I like a musky scent. This will be my scent for a while as it doesn‚Äôt take much of the spray to attract my attention. It is not overpowering but one squirt in plenty."
B0BQF23K6V,Michele the Elf,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023",Smells like oranges,"I think that this smells mostly like oranges. There are some other notes to it that are nice. The smell is all right if you like this kind of scent. As long as you use a little, it isn't overpowering. It did not give me a headache. My biggest issue with it was that it felt weird on my skin. I could feel where I had sprayed it even after it dried. It felt almost sticky. It does wash off easily with soap and water. I'm not a fan of it on my skin but I'll still use it on occasion by spraying a bit on my clothing."
B0BQF23K6V,L&S,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Costly for the size but has great subtle citrus scent,"Honestly, this product is a bit pricey at $40.00 base cost. The description states it has a woody citrus scent, but I was only able to.smell the citrus scent and nothing woody. I would presume the woody scent was suppose to be almost like a musky wood fragrance. The citrus scent is pleasant and it's very subtle and not one of those overpowering smells.

This bottle of perfume would work great for a person who can't stand to use fragrances that are too strong, over powering. As noted, it is a very subtle fragrance and smells like citrus."
B0BQF23K6V,RN,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2023",Good gift for a teen,"I don't have the scent vocabulary to describe this well. It's flowery and musky at the same time. It's a nice scent. My wife doesn't love it or hate it, but our daughter likes it quite a bit.

The small size is also ideal when traveling.

I was surprised my favorite was CHILL AF, it has a very clean smell. I did not like HAPPY AF as much, it was too floral for me. The HYPED AF was okay, I really could smell the mandarin and nectarine in it."

The bottle fits in your hand very well and has a very neat color changing feature where the bottle changes color where you touch it.

I wasn't a fan of the formatting on the box. They way they used a justified paragraph setting made the packaging look cheap. Should have just centered. The way it is now gives it a knock off/off brand feel IMO.

The product itself inside feels very high end, just wish box looked better."

Especially at this price (5.99 at time of review), you really do get to sample them out. Although they are small, you only need a few sprays. I spray 1 spritz on my wrist and 1 on my neck and it stayed with me for a while! So the small samples will last a little bit!

They all smell amazing!! Chill AF is probably my favorite, but they really all do smell really really good! Definitely going to be ordering a full size bottle of the Chill AF (and the full sized bottles look adorable)!! Super happy with these perfumes!!"

The bottle changes color too and that's so cool.

B0BQF23K6V,SmartShopperQT,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Smells Great But Too Light,All of these small perfumes smell like a breath of fresh air. It‚Äôs like nature has hit me but with sweetness. My favorite scent was Happy AF because I feel like it smelled the freshest and cleanest out of the bunch. I could also smell it on my mom from a distance away unlike the other scents. Hyped AF smelled like a mandarin that was a bit toned down and it still had a light scent. It couldn‚Äôt be smelled unless I shoved my arm into someone‚Äôs face and I found that a bit unfortunate. Chill AF smelled sweet but really was the best in capturing a woody scent out of all the perfumes in the box. It had that small spicy smell to it. It was a great blend that captured lots of sweetness but maintained the spicy side. The smell of the scents didn‚Äôt last long and I probably wouldn‚Äôt purchase them because of how light they were. I like wearing things for other people to take notice of the smell and enjoy the smell of it with me. I also felt like the sprayer could‚Äôve been better. It was much too liquid-like and didn‚Äôt have much of a mist when coming out onto the skin. There was a few times the liquid would run down my arm because of how watery it was. I liked each of the scents but they didn‚Äôt really stand out to me.

B0BQF23K6V,Lisa,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2023",Pretty decent scents,"Honestly for this being another ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù fragrance I didn‚Äôt think they were too bad. The names are extremely cringy ‚Äúaf‚Äù, but the scents make up for it. This is just a sample kit so you get to try out the 3 scents and use the bottle as a travel version. The three have their own scents that are pretty distinct from each other.

They all have a musky note to them but Hyped AF has a citrus scent, Happy AF is more floral, and Chill AF is more herbal like. My personal favorite is Hyped, it‚Äôs fresh, citrus, and fruity."
B0BQF23K6V,Nothn4me,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2023",Clean Light Orange-Citrus Scent,"I tend to like light, fresh scents when it comes to perfume and I like this fragrance.

This perfume has a clean, orange-citrus scent that is light. It is described as ""woodsy citrus"" and truly does have a nice balance (not overly citrus-like). It isn't harsh and I was able to apply immediately after a shower (pores open and no stinging, etc.). The scent lasts for hours, but does fade by the end of an 8-hr day.

The bottle is a simple orange abstract shape that really aligns with the fragrance it holds (simple, not overpowering, with a hint of orange). The spray is even and application is sufficient.

I believe it is a good value for the price. It is more expensive than a body spray, but less expensive than a designer fragrance and that is fitting."

This is just a tester set. Each of the fragrances are .05 ounces. I like that the testers are the spray type. However, when I sprayed, I didn‚Äôt always get a mist. Sometimes, I just got drops of fragrance. So spray carefully.

HYPED - I really like the Hyped scent. It was my favorite of all three. This scent has very strong citrus notes which I love. [Listed as ‚Äúmandarin, nectarine blossom, clean musk.‚Äù]

HAPPY - was a little more floral. [Listed as ‚Äúrose, pink lychee, crystalized musk.‚Äù]

CHILL - was definitely a lemon with strong musky. [Listed as ‚Äúred lemongrass, lily of the valley, milky musk.‚Äù]

None of the scents lasted very long. From my experience, they are nice for an hour or two. I applied CHILL just a few hours ago and I can‚Äôt smell it at all anymore."
B0BQF23K6V,HechoEnColorado,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2023",Scent Is Good. Lacking in Other Respects.,"I only marginally know who Addison Rae is, but I can definitively say I am not the target market for wearing this perfume. However, I enjoy new scents and have a fear of smelling like an old woman (brought on by my grandma, who wore the same stinky awful scent for years), so I decided to try this out.

This scent is very light and refreshing. It stays on for a bit, but it could certainly last longer. It needs to be reapplied throughout the day.

The bottle is cute, though a bit gimmicky (anyone remember Hypercolor from the early 90s?).

And though I'm not the target market for wearing this, I am certainly (as a middle-aged suburban mom) the target market for purchasing an item like this as a gift for a young woman. When considering the perfume from this aspect, I would point out that though I personally have a mouth like a trucker, it's a little tacky to have the ""AF"" in the name. If I were considering perfume as a gift for a teen girl, I'd probably go with something a little more classic."
B0BQF23K6V,How'd That Pet Hair Get There,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2023",One Spray Lasts All Day,"The best way I would describe the perfume is that it's a very potent youthful floral aroma that would be best worn in well ventilated areas, and or during outdoor activities. I sprayed the perfume in the air, walked through it, and I kid you not, a week later I could still smell the perfume on my clothes when I went to do laundry. By no means did I go overboard when I sprayed it as I only did one click, but by the end of the day I had such a horrible headache. I still think it smells okay, but my senses were definitely overloaded."

B0BQF23K6V,Laura,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2023",Would make a good stocking Stuffer,"This would make a cute stocking stuffer and would give someone a chance to try three different perfumes. The samples are quite small but I do really like two of the perfumes. The chill af perfume is very musky and mysterious but still smells youthful. The hyped af smells florally and sweet and is definitely my favorite. The happy af perfume has a very strong citrusy smell which I do not like, literally smells like you are wearing oranges, not for me at all."
B0BQF23K6V,KC,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023","Nice, light citrus scent","I tried this by spraying it on my arm and then periodically sniffing it through the day. It is a light, pleasant citrus type smell. You can definitely smell the mandarin/orange scent, but there is more to it than that too. It is a fairly light scent and wasn't overpowering to me and also didn't give me an instant headache, which is a huge plus because some perfumes bother me, but so far, this one hasn't. I didn't notice the scent as time went by, but if I sniffed my arm, the scent was still there. It is pleasant, though maybe not my personal favorite. I think most people who like an orange-type citrus scent will like it and it would make a nice gift."
B0BQF23K6V,Saturnalia,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Super Citrus Scent But Wears Off Quickly,"I absolutely love trying new fragrances and this sounded perfect for summer. The bottle is super cool. It's completely yellow because it was really hot but it's hyper color like the shirts from the 90's and changes colors from dark orange to yellow when you hold it. It's not alcohol based so when you spritz it comes out in a stream instead of a mist. It does leave some oily residue behind. When you first spray the perfume you get hit strongly with the smell of the blood orange and nectarine. It's very, very orangey but that super strong citrus smell wears off quickly and leaves a light, pleasant orange and lemon smell. I was really hoping once the top notes wore off I would be left with the low, woodsy notes mentioned but I didn't smell any. After an hour I could barely smell it on my wrist. I will still use this for a fun, summer fragrance but it's not a fragrance I would purchase again. If you love the scent of strong, orange perfume this would be perfect for you but it's too one note for me. I prefer more complex fragrances that last longer than an hour."
B0BQF23K6V,Jillian Schreck,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Color changing bottle,"I love this cute compact perfume bottle. The color changes with heat from your fingers which is a fun added bonus. The scent is very good, very musky but still tangerine. I didn‚Äôt think I would like it but it is very refreshing. My biggest complaint is that the smell just doesn‚Äôt seem to stick on me for some reason‚Ä¶I can smell it when I put it on but not much after at times. It is a very beautiful but faint smell. I appreciate the vibrancy of the packaging it is very suitable for the scent, two contrasting scents mixed but in a good way!"
B0BQF23K6V,Unik,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Smells like pears üçê,"This is a very fruity fragrance that smells like a bowl of sweet candy. It‚Äôs very fruity/sweet but you can still grasp the floral aroma (although not as dominate). This comes off as a younger woman‚Äôs fragrance that would typical gravitate towards ‚Äútrendy‚Äù scents in similar price ranges.

The bottle design is very nice, better than a lot of others in this price range. It‚Äôs a matte bottle and cap that easily snaps open/close. I really like the bottle and it‚Äôs color design (maybe more than the fragrance itself). The fragrance overall is good, not a bad fragrance at all. It's too fruity for my preference but a lovely giftable item for the right person."

The scent is redolent of flowers with a delightful undertone of musky patchouli. I love spicy perfumes, not to sweet or flowery and not like the deep woods. This one is the perfect blend and does, indeed, spark a good mood.
If you are a sporty type who enjoys the outdoors and long walks in the woods or along a raging river you will love this fragrance."

The presentation is overall rather cheap looking, with the bottle changing colors related to heat, which is the kind of gimmick I expect to be aimed towards a younger crowd.

B0BQF23K6V,John Greybeard,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023","Leaves a sticky residue on your skin, and it smells like orange juice","I don't know if I got a bad batch or not, but this stuff is horrible. It smells way too citrusy, and it leaves your skin feeling sticky. I'm starting to think they put orange juice in this stuff with as sticky as it is. The smell it leaves after it sits a while isn't so bad, but my wife had to wash her arms because of how it felt on her skin. I consider myself a perfume/cologne connoisseur, and we've had everything from budget brands at the dollar store to brands as expensive as Creed, so I'd classify this as a something you'd probably buy at Walmart for a teenage girl. I did want to give this at least 3 stars, because it does have a unique smell after sitting for a while. but it's definitely not a perfume for a 37 year old woman. If it weren't so sticky I'd have bumped it up to 4 stars. As far as my recommendations for improvements, I'd drop the price to about $20 and label it for teenagers, then get the formula fixed so it isn't so sticky."

B0BQF23K6V,Jonathan C,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2023",Orange cream soda,"The scent is orange essential oil with a hint of lemon mint and cream soda. It is delicious and smells natural.

The ingredients list is short which suggests Addison made an effort to reduce toxic chemicals typical in almost all conventional perfumes.

For an EDP, it doesn't last very long. When your primary fragrance is essential oils, the scent only lasts a couple of hours at most.

My daughter absolutely loves it."
B0BQF23K6V,Tom,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023","nice and fresh, but doesn't last long","This smells citrucy and fresh in the beginning, but due to the lack of heavy bottom notes, the effect doesn't last long. Citrucy top notes evaporate within 2-3 hours, and this is no different for this perfume. This is somewhat of a disappointment for a perfume, but also expected from its composition with plenty of citrucy top notes.
Also, about 15-20 minutes after the application, there is a distinct take over of lemon, which unfortunately makes it transiently smell a bit like 'lemon-fresh' scents of various household products."
B0BQF23K6V,Ma'ama,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Sweet floral and fruity fragrance for older kids and teens.,This has a fruity floral fragrance that smells sweet and youthful.

B0BQF23K6V,Miss Pink Lemonade,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Little Samples that Help You Determine if You Would Like the Full-Size Version ...,"These three samples are the type you might get with a purchase at a cosmetics/fragrance counter or even at a cosmetics/fragrance shop. The vials are typical sample size and instead of a mist, it comes out as a fast stream (so go easy here).

Sure, it's a little gimmicky, but there is some silly fun here as well. ""Hyped"" is an overall good scent: it's a little like Tocca Stella, but a little less nuanced and layered. Now, ""Happy"" is genuinely cheery. There almost seem to be sugary notes here. It's a more layered scent that translates as simple and pretty. And ""Chill"" is a little basic but in a good way. The Lilly of the Valley really sings here. All fragrances have musk as their base (or ""bottom"" note).

Since these fragrances are not sold in my area, this was a good way to sample them to see if I wished to order the full-sized versions."

My favorites are Chill and Hyped. Happy is floral, which is okay, but florals are not my favorites. All of the fragrances are very understated, but ""pretty"" smelling. I have to put my nose right up to my wrists to smell them.
This sampler set is a nice way to pick your new favorite perfume from this brand, and I would recommend it."
B0BQF23K6V,Carrie,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023",Scent doesn‚Äôt last long,"This perfume is very tangerine/citrusy smelling. It‚Äôs nice, but I was hoping for more of the woody scent in the description. It didn‚Äôt seem to last very long."
B0BQF23K6V,Iris Insights,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023",Not strong or long lasting,These are very tiny samples. The perfumes smell nice but I didn‚Äôt find them to be very strong scents and I couldn‚Äôt really smell them on myself or get a whiff of the scent while wearing it.
B0BQF23K6V,Joshua Vittachi,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2023",So nice!,"I was skeptical because I‚Äôm not a huge floral scent person but this is so subtle and soft of a fragrance but yet still so inviting that it has become my new favorite! And the glass bottle that it is in is heat sensitive so when you touch it, it changes colors which is super fun. Very giftable or even to keep for yourself. Will last me a long while. Love!! -wife‚Äôs review"
B0BQF23K6V,OptimusPrime,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023",Accurately named,"Happy AF is very appropriately named. When I spray it on I get an immediate mood lift. The bottle is so unique and quirky as it changes colors with the heat of your hands. The scent is a fun, fruity floral that is so uplifting and beautiful. It lasts 2-3 hours on me but I don‚Äôt mind reapplying it several times a day to get another boost of happy!"
B0BQF23K6V,P J,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2023",Love this!!,"Ok I'm not a big perfume person, generally don't wear perfume but I really like this one!! I generally don't wear any because I have kids that have asthma and a lot of strong smells interfere with it but I can put this one on and go right by them and it don't bother them at all!! That's a big bonus in my book!!!! It has a light scent to it just with one squirt. I'm sure it would be stronger with more but that is all I need."
B0BQF23K6V,mama Ruggles,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023","Nice scent, poor delivery"," The smell of this is light, I definitely feel like it's a younger scent, but I would be comfortable wearing it as an older person too. Perfume is really subjective so difficult to review- but it's not a horrible smell. The bottle is cute, but the spray really comes out a stream."
B0BQF23K6V,C. Cowles,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Cute sampler,"This comes as a set of three tiny spray samples to test out the three fragrances by Addison Rae. All three smell good. I just wish they lasted longer as they start to fade after a couple hours and I prefer perfumes with longevity. If you don't mind having to reapply ever so often, the floral/fruit and musky scents are great for summer."
B0BQF23K6V,Just some person,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023",Happy scent in a unique bottle,"I love the smell. It's not too weak and also not overpowering. I spray it on my clothes and it has decent staying power throughout the day.
I forget what the fragrance notes are ""supposed"" to be, but my personal interpretation after just spraying a few minutes ago is citrus, grape, and rose.
Also I have to mention the very interesting bottle. I love it. It's an odd pebble shape covered with a heat-sensitive color changing paint. It's very creative and a joy to the senses.
Overall, I definitely recommend this fragrance if you like bright joyful scents and very unique packaging."
B0BQF23K6V,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023",a new favorite?,"I got the hyped and chill AF perfumes
Both smell awesome! The hyped is an orange citrus clean scent that just smells like summer in a bottle. The chill is a light floral sandalwood beach smell, both scents are light and not over powering and smell great! They last a good while too. The bottles are also interesting and different, they are VIBRANT, and they change color to touch.
Would be a great gift for a teenager or young adult"
B0BQF23K6V,Fashionista Gal,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023",Beautiful fun HAPPY perfume! No alcohol formula makes it spectacular!,"This is delicious and fun as a perfume. I love light citrus florals so this is spot on. I smelled it and said it reminded me of the Happy we know from that cosmetic line, but this is more complex, not a straight citrus but mixed delightfully with rose, peony, and other complimentary ingredients. I love that there is no alcohol and it is a water based product. There is no alcohol tone to the fragrance, with the bright notes popping first. I feel the fragrance lasts a long time, and, at first I did t think one squirt was enough, and added another, and I think it takes a minute for the perfume to hit the skin and start to offer more aroma.

The bottle is really unique too. It changes colors with the heat from touch. My photo doesn‚Äôt show very well, as I‚Äôm in an air conditioned room but this bottle will turn pink if held for long. It‚Äôs fun and I will enjoy putting it out on my dresser. I don‚Äôt often buy perfume, and this feels like a department store line. It‚Äôs certainly impressing me more than most fancy ones. The lack of alcohol as the carrier ingredient makes a huge difference, and the fragrance is sooo much better for it.

This would make a perfect gift, it‚Äôs a lot of fun, and smells good enough I‚Äôll remember to wear it !!! Recommend!!!! Love love it."
B0BQF23K6V,Bob & Claire,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2023",Flowery Citrus Scent in a Color Changing Bottle,"First off, the bottle is cool. Reminds me to a mood ring in that the bottle changes based on temperature. I feel that is a nice added touch. The fragrance itself is a fruity floral light scent. The scent lasted for about 4 to 6 hours which is good to get through the day."
B0BQF23K6V,B Harvey,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2023",Smells great on women in my opinion,"I got this for a woman in my life and she loves to wear it. I think it smells great, but I don't know enough about scents to know how to describe it. I guess the main thing I think of when I smell it is clean, it smells like someone just got out of a nice bath with scented oils in it or something to me.

The bottle it's in is cool, it changes colors where it heats up, so basically when you're holding it your fingers can change its colors. The way it's packaged makes it a great gift, too. All in all this is a good buy and for the price you get a great scent in a bottle that is very cool to see on the shelf."
B0BQF23K6V,Just my 2 sense of things,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2023",nice Citrus note,at first wife was not a fan I liked it tho sweet Citrus but as soon as she spray it on her body it changes and she loved it it's Long lasting too after a long day I can Still smell it on her very well
B0BQF23K6V,Patricia Evans,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Surprisingly light,"Several interesting things - it smells great first of all.
It reminds me more of essential oils put together in the just right blend. They feel is like that too - so I'll say that if you put on a lot, you'll feel a teeny bit of oil residue on the skin. But it takes a lot. Some of that is because it has good ingredients.
Next was even with adding more it smelled even better but didn't overwhelm my senses - didn't give me a headache like some perfumes can.
And it smelled different at different points - at first you could smell some of the spicy and some of the bergamot notes, then it shifts to lighter more floral with the lily of the valley and pear blossom.
I really enjoy the scent and found myself delighted in wearing it.
Last thing - the top of the bottle - is heat sensitive. So I couldn't help myself and tried to make patterns just holding it. Neat addition to an already nice product."
B0BQF23K6V,Dawn Wenner,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2023",Memorable scent,"First thing is the bottle. It is just fun no matter what your age. Every time you touch it, it is a different color. But the smell is fabulous and doesn‚Äôt smell like just another strong perfume. I do not like floral scent of any kind but this doesn‚Äôt give that to me. I am not good at identifying different notes and know that I like a musky scent. This will be my scent for a while as it doesn‚Äôt take much of the spray to attract my attention. It is not overpowering but one squirt in plenty."
B0BQF23K6V,Michele the Elf,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023",Smells like oranges,"I think that this smells mostly like oranges. There are some other notes to it that are nice. The smell is all right if you like this kind of scent. As long as you use a little, it isn't overpowering. It did not give me a headache. My biggest issue with it was that it felt weird on my skin. I could feel where I had sprayed it even after it dried. It felt almost sticky. It does wash off easily with soap and water. I'm not a fan of it on my skin but I'll still use it on occasion by spraying a bit on my clothing."
B0BQF23K6V,L&S,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Costly for the size but has great subtle citrus scent,"Honestly, this product is a bit pricey at $40.00 base cost. The description states it has a woody citrus scent, but I was only able to.smell the citrus scent and nothing woody. I would presume the woody scent was suppose to be almost like a musky wood fragrance. The citrus scent is pleasant and it's very subtle and not one of those overpowering smells.

This bottle of perfume would work great for a person who can't stand to use fragrances that are too strong, over powering. As noted, it is a very subtle fragrance and smells like citrus."
B0BQF23K6V,RN,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2023",Good gift for a teen,"I don't have the scent vocabulary to describe this well. It's flowery and musky at the same time. It's a nice scent. My wife doesn't love it or hate it, but our daughter likes it quite a bit.

The bottle is fun. It changes color like a mood ring. It's a gimmick, but people like gimmicks.

This would make a good gift for a teen."
B0BQF23K6V,C. L,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023",Great little sampler set,"This Addison Rae Fragrance Set by Addison Rae Fragrance is 3 fragrance samplers in a cardboard sleeve, it arrives inside a bubble wrap bag.

The sampler set allows you to experience all 3 fragrances to see if you like them before committing to a large bottle. I'm not a frequent fragrance wearer so these samplers are perfect for me, I get to try multiple scents for one low price and a sampler is generally enough for the special occasions where I would use a fragrance. The small size is also ideal when traveling.

I was surprised my favorite was CHILL AF, it has a very clean smell. I did not like HAPPY AF as much, it was too floral for me. The HYPED AF was okay, I really could smell the mandarin and nectarine in it."
B0BQF23K6V,Jam,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2023",Doesn‚Äôt last long.,"The longevity of this fragrance is pretty weak. I stop smelling it within an hour of putting it on. The scent is somewhat reminiscent of the b&bw 90s scent pearberry. It is definitely a tween perfume. The component is cool, but I don‚Äôt think that this perfume is really worth the 40.00 price point."
B0BQF23K6V,Aegiscrash,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2023",Great Sampler Set,"This is a small sample of three different Eau de Parfum (EDP) from Addison Rae. Chill and Happy are both great scents, i can see these for day or evening wear. Overall safe scents. Hyped is just a bit too much lemon, its not offensive but just too strong in the one scent profile. Great buy if you wanna try before buy to a larger purchase."
B0BQF23K6V,BirdNerd,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Surprise! üíúüíôüíú,"So I forgot about the color changing bottle feature, and was a little sad when I opened the gorgeous purple and blue gradient box to find a solid baby blue bottle.
The perfume smells AMAZING (I‚Äôm SO sensitive and picky with scents!) so I was still going to rate it highly since that‚Äôs the most important aspect of course. Took it back out of the pretty box to take photos and it was purple and blue!
Realization dawned on me and I held it in the freezer air for just a moment and watched it turn completely purple‚Ä¶ except for where my warm fingers were touching it. üòÑüòçüíôüíúüíô
That was fun.
Absolutely love this scent."
B0BQF23K6V,MDgirl1053,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Smell is very nice. Awesome touch sensitive bottle,"The smell of this perfume is very subtle, floral, and feminine. Overall it is a pleasing scent and my husband liked it. Very young and fresh feeling. The bottle fits in your hand very well and has a very neat color changing feature where the bottle changes color where you touch it.

I wasn't a fan of the formatting on the box. They way they used a justified paragraph setting made the packaging look cheap. Should have just centered. The way it is now gives it a knock off/off brand feel IMO.

The product itself inside feels very high end, just wish box looked better."
B0BQF23K6V,Veronica B,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",LOVE this sampler pack!!,"I love sampler packs like this that let you try different scents out prior to ordering a full size! Especially at this price (5.99 at time of review), you really do get to sample them out. Although they are small, you only need a few sprays. I spray 1 spritz on my wrist and 1 on my neck and it stayed with me for a while! So the small samples will last a little bit!

They all smell amazing!! Chill AF is probably my favorite, but they really all do smell really really good! Definitely going to be ordering a full size bottle of the Chill AF (and the full sized bottles look adorable)!! Super happy with these perfumes!!"
B0BQF23K6V,Dingle Girl,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2023",Lovely scent,"I am so pleased with Chill AF by Addison Rae. It has a wonderful fresh scent, similar to my favorite BB&W, Gingham Love. The bottle is incredibly cool and unique with the color changing ability based on body heat. It is fun just to play with the bottle. Highly recommend Chill AF, a subtle long lasting scent."
B0BQF23K6V,Deemama,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2023",Obsessed!,"This perfume really, really smells so good. I was super surprised at how great it smells. It has a hint of vanilla and a citrusy sweet smell. I really like it a lot. I‚Äôve had so many people both men and women comment on how good it smells on me. I rarely get any compliments on other perfumes that I‚Äôve had on but this one, people have actually asked what I‚Äôm wearing. It‚Äôs a great scent. Even my teenaged daughter loves it and took it from me! I would definitely recommend this perfume to everyone I know!"
B0BQF23K6V,Holly,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2023",Great Summer Perfume,"So I fully admit, I had to look up who Addison Rae was but I have to say this Gen Z star made an awesome perfume! It has a strong scent that is a unique mix of citrus/ orange and earthy/woody which smells great. The perfume bottle is compact and changes color when you touch it applying heat. It's easy to open and to spray."
B0BQF23K6V,Reviewer,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Very clean smelling scents,"I really like all of these perfumes. These are just sample size to try before you buy a large bottle.

They all smell really good and fresh. Chill af is my favorite its a light fresh scent with no extra scents added.

I did notice a light stickiness after use but it wasn't enough to make me not like it, maybe due to an ingredient?
I would buy all of these perfumes in a large size."

B0BQF23K6V,Matics07,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2023",My new favorite perfume,"This perfume is exactly what I like. It has a nice fruity scent that is not overpowering. This is a perfect summer scent. It actually does really have a calming note to it.

The bottle is fun as well. It is a nice compact size that would be easy to throw in your purse and it is hypercolor. It turns a light blue where I touch it."
B0BQF23K6V,Sama,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2023",Lovely,"This is gorgeous, the packaging and it is in is just lovely. The color of the bottle is as described.

B0BQF23K6V,Angela,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023",Great subtle smell,"First, let's talk about the bottle. It has almost a rubber feel, but is heat reactive. My bottle is a bluish purple and changes to a beautiful sky blue color with heat. This perfume smells amazing. It is not strong at all and has a fruity-woodsy smell. It is a great scent for summer. The listed price is great and I would highly recommend this as a gift or personal use."
B0BQF23K6V,M.B. Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023","Delightful floral, fruity scent. Smells expensive.","I am *very* picky about fragrances, and this one is delightful.

I'd say the description in terms of various aroma notes, and the overall presentation is bright, fresh, and fun. It doesn't smell cloying, sweet or cheap.

If you told me this was an expensive department store perfume I would absolutely believe you.

Also the bottle that it comes in is a very unique and cool design as well. Easy five stars."

This perfume smells like ""oranges"" according to my 15 year old. The packaging states the fragrance is cruelty free, alcohol free, and vegan. The packaging is super cute and I enjoy the smell.

B0BQF29FLQ,SmartShopperQT,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Smells Great But Too Light,All of these small perfumes smell like a breath of fresh air. It‚Äôs like nature has hit me but with sweetness. My favorite scent was Happy AF because I feel like it smelled the freshest and cleanest out of the bunch. I could also smell it on my mom from a distance away unlike the other scents. Hyped AF smelled like a mandarin that was a bit toned down and it still had a light scent. It couldn‚Äôt be smelled unless I shoved my arm into someone‚Äôs face and I found that a bit unfortunate. Chill AF smelled sweet but really was the best in capturing a woody scent out of all the perfumes in the box. It had that small spicy smell to it. It was a great blend that captured lots of sweetness but maintained the spicy side. The smell of the scents didn‚Äôt last long and I probably wouldn‚Äôt purchase them because of how light they were. I like wearing things for other people to take notice of the smell and enjoy the smell of it with me. I also felt like the sprayer could‚Äôve been better. It was much too liquid-like and didn‚Äôt have much of a mist when coming out onto the skin. There was a few times the liquid would run down my arm because of how watery it was. I liked each of the scents but they didn‚Äôt really stand out to me.

B0BQF29FLQ,Lisa,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2023",Pretty decent scents,"Honestly for this being another ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù fragrance I didn‚Äôt think they were too bad. The names are extremely cringy ‚Äúaf‚Äù, but the scents make up for it. This is just a sample kit so you get to try out the 3 scents and use the bottle as a travel version. The three have their own scents that are pretty distinct from each other.

They all have a musky note to them but Hyped AF has a citrus scent, Happy AF is more floral, and Chill AF is more herbal like. My personal favorite is Hyped, it‚Äôs fresh, citrus, and fruity."
B0BQF29FLQ,Nothn4me,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2023",Clean Light Orange-Citrus Scent,"I tend to like light, fresh scents when it comes to perfume and I like this fragrance.

This perfume has a clean, orange-citrus scent that is light. It is described as ""woodsy citrus"" and truly does have a nice balance (not overly citrus-like). It isn't harsh and I was able to apply immediately after a shower (pores open and no stinging, etc.). The scent lasts for hours, but does fade by the end of an 8-hr day.

The bottle is a simple orange abstract shape that really aligns with the fragrance it holds (simple, not overpowering, with a hint of orange). The spray is even and application is sufficient.

I believe it is a good value for the price. It is more expensive than a body spray, but less expensive than a designer fragrance and that is fitting."

This is just a tester set. Each of the fragrances are .05 ounces. I like that the testers are the spray type. However, when I sprayed, I didn‚Äôt always get a mist. Sometimes, I just got drops of fragrance. So spray carefully.

HYPED - I really like the Hyped scent. It was my favorite of all three. This scent has very strong citrus notes which I love. [Listed as ‚Äúmandarin, nectarine blossom, clean musk.‚Äù]

HAPPY - was a little more floral. [Listed as ‚Äúrose, pink lychee, crystalized musk.‚Äù]

CHILL - was definitely a lemon with strong musky. [Listed as ‚Äúred lemongrass, lily of the valley, milky musk.‚Äù]

B0BQF29FLQ,HechoEnColorado,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2023",Scent Is Good. Lacking in Other Respects.,"I only marginally know who Addison Rae is, but I can definitively say I am not the target market for wearing this perfume. However, I enjoy new scents and have a fear of smelling like an old woman (brought on by my grandma, who wore the same stinky awful scent for years), so I decided to try this out.

This scent is very light and refreshing. It stays on for a bit, but it could certainly last longer. It needs to be reapplied throughout the day.

The bottle is cute, though a bit gimmicky (anyone remember Hypercolor from the early 90s?).

And though I'm not the target market for wearing this, I am certainly (as a middle-aged suburban mom) the target market for purchasing an item like this as a gift for a young woman. When considering the perfume from this aspect, I would point out that though I personally have a mouth like a trucker, it's a little tacky to have the ""AF"" in the name. If I were considering perfume as a gift for a teen girl, I'd probably go with something a little more classic."

I sprayed the perfume in the air, walked through it, and I kid you not, a week later I could still smell the perfume on my clothes when I went to do laundry. By no means did I go overboard when I sprayed it as I only did one click, but by the end of the day I had such a horrible headache. I still think it smells okay, but my senses were definitely overloaded."

B0BQF29FLQ,Laura,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2023",Would make a good stocking Stuffer,"This would make a cute stocking stuffer and would give someone a chance to try three different perfumes. The samples are quite small but I do really like two of the perfumes. The chill af perfume is very musky and mysterious but still smells youthful. The hyped af smells florally and sweet and is definitely my favorite. The happy af perfume has a very strong citrusy smell which I do not like, literally smells like you are wearing oranges, not for me at all."
B0BQF29FLQ,KC,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023","Nice, light citrus scent","I tried this by spraying it on my arm and then periodically sniffing it through the day. It is a light, pleasant citrus type smell. You can definitely smell the mandarin/orange scent, but there is more to it than that too. It is a fairly light scent and wasn't overpowering to me and also didn't give me an instant headache, which is a huge plus because some perfumes bother me, but so far, this one hasn't. I didn't notice the scent as time went by, but if I sniffed my arm, the scent was still there. It is pleasant, though maybe not my personal favorite. I think most people who like an orange-type citrus scent will like it and it would make a nice gift."
B0BQF29FLQ,Saturnalia,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Super Citrus Scent But Wears Off Quickly,"I absolutely love trying new fragrances and this sounded perfect for summer. The bottle is super cool. It's completely yellow because it was really hot but it's hyper color like the shirts from the 90's and changes colors from dark orange to yellow when you hold it. It's not alcohol based so when you spritz it comes out in a stream instead of a mist. It does leave some oily residue behind. When you first spray the perfume you get hit strongly with the smell of the blood orange and nectarine. It's very, very orangey but that super strong citrus smell wears off quickly and leaves a light, pleasant orange and lemon smell. I was really hoping once the top notes wore off I would be left with the low, woodsy notes mentioned but I didn't smell any. After an hour I could barely smell it on my wrist. I will still use this for a fun, summer fragrance but it's not a fragrance I would purchase again. If you love the scent of strong, orange perfume this would be perfect for you but it's too one note for me. I prefer more complex fragrances that last longer than an hour."
B0BQF29FLQ,Jillian Schreck,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Color changing bottle,"I love this cute compact perfume bottle.

My biggest complaint is that the smell just doesn‚Äôt seem to stick on me for some reason‚Ä¶I can smell it when I put it on but not much after at times. It is a very beautiful but faint smell.

B0BQF29FLQ,Unik,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Smells like pears üçê,"This is a very fruity fragrance that smells like a bowl of sweet candy. It‚Äôs very fruity/sweet but you can still grasp the floral aroma (although not as dominate). This comes off as a younger woman‚Äôs fragrance that would typical gravitate towards ‚Äútrendy‚Äù scents in similar price ranges.

The bottle design is very nice, better than a lot of others in this price range. It‚Äôs a matte bottle and cap that easily snaps open/close. I really like the bottle and it‚Äôs color design (maybe more than the fragrance itself). The fragrance overall is good, not a bad fragrance at all. It's too fruity for my preference but a lovely giftable item for the right person."
B0BQF29FLQ,K. Peterson,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2023",Smell Delicious,"My bottle arrived yesterday and two things seemed wonderful, the spicy perfume and the color changing bottle (it arrived a bright pink and was soon blueish purple).
The scent is redolent of flowers with a delightful undertone of musky patchouli. I love spicy perfumes, not to sweet or flowery and not like the deep woods. This one is the perfect blend and does, indeed, spark a good mood.
If you are a sporty type who enjoys the outdoors and long walks in the woods or along a raging river you will love this fragrance."

The presentation is overall rather cheap looking, with the bottle changing colors related to heat, which is the kind of gimmick I expect to be aimed towards a younger crowd.

It smells way too citrusy, and it leaves your skin feeling sticky. I'm starting to think they put orange juice in this stuff with as sticky as it is. The smell it leaves after it sits a while isn't so bad, but my wife had to wash her arms because of how it felt on her skin. I consider myself a perfume/cologne connoisseur, and we've had everything from budget brands at the dollar store to brands as expensive as Creed, so I'd classify this as a something you'd probably buy at Walmart for a teenage girl. I did want to give this at least 3 stars, because it does have a unique smell after sitting for a while. but it's definitely not a perfume for a 37 year old woman. If it weren't so sticky I'd have bumped it up to 4 stars. As far as my recommendations for improvements, I'd drop the price to about $20 and label it for teenagers, then get the formula fixed so it isn't so sticky."

B0BQF29FLQ,Jonathan C,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2023",Orange cream soda,"The scent is orange essential oil with a hint of lemon mint and cream soda. It is delicious and smells natural.

The ingredients list is short which suggests Addison made an effort to reduce toxic chemicals typical in almost all conventional perfumes.

For an EDP, it doesn't last very long. When your primary fragrance is essential oils, the scent only lasts a couple of hours at most.

My daughter absolutely loves it."
B0BQF29FLQ,Tom,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023","nice and fresh, but doesn't last long","This smells citrucy and fresh in the beginning, but due to the lack of heavy bottom notes, the effect doesn't last long. Citrucy top notes evaporate within 2-3 hours, and this is no different for this perfume. This is somewhat of a disappointment for a perfume, but also expected from its composition with plenty of citrucy top notes.
Also, about 15-20 minutes after the application, there is a distinct take over of lemon, which unfortunately makes it transiently smell a bit like 'lemon-fresh' scents of various household products."

The vials are typical sample size and instead of a mist, it comes out as a fast stream (so go easy here).

Sure, it's a little gimmicky, but there is some silly fun here as well. ""Hyped"" is an overall good scent: it's a little like Tocca Stella, but a little less nuanced and layered. Now, ""Happy"" is genuinely cheery. There almost seem to be sugary notes here. It's a more layered scent that translates as simple and pretty. And ""Chill"" is a little basic but in a good way. The Lilly of the Valley really sings here. All fragrances have musk as their base (or ""bottom"" note).

Since these fragrances are not sold in my area, this was a good way to sample them to see if I wished to order the full-sized versions."

B0BQF29FLQ,Fashionista Gal,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023",Beautiful fun HAPPY perfume! No alcohol formula makes it spectacular!,"This is delicious and fun as a perfume. I love light citrus florals so this is spot on. I smelled it and said it reminded me of the Happy we know from that cosmetic line, but this is more complex, not a straight citrus but mixed delightfully with rose, peony, and other complimentary ingredients. I love that there is no alcohol and it is a water based product. There is no alcohol tone to the fragrance, with the bright notes popping first. I feel the fragrance lasts a long time, and, at first I did t think one squirt was enough, and added another, and I think it takes a minute for the perfume to hit the skin and start to offer more aroma.

The bottle is really unique too. It changes colors with the heat from touch. My photo doesn‚Äôt show very well, as I‚Äôm in an air conditioned room but this bottle will turn pink if held for long. It‚Äôs fun and I will enjoy putting it out on my dresser. I don‚Äôt often buy perfume, and this feels like a department store line. It‚Äôs certainly impressing me more than most fancy ones. The lack of alcohol as the carrier ingredient makes a huge difference, and the fragrance is sooo much better for it.

I guess the main thing I think of when I smell it is clean, it smells like someone just got out of a nice bath with scented oils in it or something to me.

The bottle it's in is cool, it changes colors where it heats up, so basically when you're holding it your fingers can change its colors. The way it's packaged makes it a great gift, too.

B0BQF29FLQ,Patricia Evans,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Surprisingly light,"Several interesting things - it smells great first of all.
It reminds me more of essential oils put together in the just right blend. They feel is like that too - so I'll say that if you put on a lot, you'll feel a teeny bit of oil residue on the skin. But it takes a lot. Some of that is because it has good ingredients.
Next was even with adding more it smelled even better but didn't overwhelm my senses - didn't give me a headache like some perfumes can.
And it smelled different at different points - at first you could smell some of the spicy and some of the bergamot notes, then it shifts to lighter more floral with the lily of the valley and pear blossom.
I really enjoy the scent and found myself delighted in wearing it.
Last thing - the top of the bottle - is heat sensitive. So I couldn't help myself and tried to make patterns just holding it. Neat addition to an already nice product."

Hyped is just a bit too much lemon, its not offensive but just too strong in the one scent profile. Great buy if you wanna try before buy to a larger purchase."
B0BQF29FLQ,BirdNerd,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Surprise! üíúüíôüíú,"So I forgot about the color changing bottle feature, and was a little sad when I opened the gorgeous purple and blue gradient box to find a solid baby blue bottle.
The perfume smells AMAZING (I‚Äôm SO sensitive and picky with scents!) so I was still going to rate it highly since that‚Äôs the most important aspect of course. Took it back out of the pretty box to take photos and it was purple and blue!
Realization dawned on me and I held it in the freezer air for just a moment and watched it turn completely purple‚Ä¶ except for where my warm fingers were touching it. üòÑüòçüíôüíúüíô
That was fun.
Absolutely love this scent."
B0BQF29FLQ,MDgirl1053,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Smell is very nice. Awesome touch sensitive bottle,"The smell of this perfume is very subtle, floral, and feminine. Overall it is a pleasing scent and my husband liked it. Very young and fresh feeling. The bottle fits in your hand very well and has a very neat color changing feature where the bottle changes color where you touch it.

I wasn't a fan of the formatting on the box. They way they used a justified paragraph setting made the packaging look cheap. Should have just centered. The way it is now gives it a knock off/off brand feel IMO.

The product itself inside feels very high end, just wish box looked better."
B0BQF29FLQ,Veronica B,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",LOVE this sampler pack!!,"I love sampler packs like this that let you try different scents out prior to ordering a full size! Especially at this price (5.99 at time of review), you really do get to sample them out. Although they are small, you only need a few sprays. I spray 1 spritz on my wrist and 1 on my neck and it stayed with me for a while! So the small samples will last a little bit!

They all smell amazing!! Chill AF is probably my favorite, but they really all do smell really really good! Definitely going to be ordering a full size bottle of the Chill AF (and the full sized bottles look adorable)!! Super happy with these perfumes!!"
B0BQF29FLQ,Dingle Girl,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2023",Lovely scent,"I am so pleased with Chill AF by Addison Rae. It has a wonderful fresh scent, similar to my favorite BB&W, Gingham Love. The bottle is incredibly cool and unique with the color changing ability based on body heat. It is fun just to play with the bottle. Highly recommend Chill AF, a subtle long lasting scent."
B0BQF29FLQ,Deemama,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2023",Obsessed!,"This perfume really, really smells so good. I was super surprised at how great it smells. It has a hint of vanilla and a citrusy sweet smell. I really like it a lot. I‚Äôve had so many people both men and women comment on how good it smells on me. I rarely get any compliments on other perfumes that I‚Äôve had on but this one, people have actually asked what I‚Äôm wearing. It‚Äôs a great scent. Even my teenaged daughter loves it and took it from me! I would definitely recommend this perfume to everyone I know!"
B0BQF29FLQ,Holly,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2023",Great Summer Perfume,"So I fully admit, I had to look up who Addison Rae was but I have to say this Gen Z star made an awesome perfume!

It's easy to open and to spray."
B0BQF29FLQ,Reviewer,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Very clean smelling scents,"I really like all of these perfumes. These are just sample size to try before you buy a large bottle.

They all smell really good and fresh. Chill af is my favorite its a light fresh scent with no extra scents added.

I did notice a light stickiness after use but it wasn't enough to make me not like it, maybe due to an ingredient?
I would buy all of these perfumes in a large size."

B0BQF29FLQ,Angela,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023",Great subtle smell,"First, let's talk about the bottle. It has almost a rubber feel, but is heat reactive. My bottle is a bluish purple and changes to a beautiful sky blue color with heat. This perfume smells amazing. It is not strong at all and has a fruity-woodsy smell. It is a great scent for summer. The listed price is great and I would highly recommend this as a gift or personal use."
B0BQF29FLQ,M.B. Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023","Delightful floral, fruity scent. Smells expensive.","I am *very* picky about fragrances, and this one is delightful.

I'd say the description in terms of various aroma notes, and the overall presentation is bright, fresh, and fun. It doesn't smell cloying, sweet or cheap.

If you told me this was an expensive department store perfume I would absolutely believe you.

Also the bottle that it comes in is a very unique and cool design as well. Easy five stars."

This perfume smells like ""oranges"" according to my 15 year old. The packaging states the fragrance is cruelty free, alcohol free, and vegan. The packaging is super cute and I enjoy the smell.

B0BQF29FLQ,Dee,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2023",Long lasting scent,"This perfume smells great, the scent is sweet and fruity, with hints of citrus and berries. It's just the right amount of fragrance, and is perfect for everyday wear. My daughter loves this scent and so do I."

The bottle changes color too and that's so cool.

It's one of those perfumes that had me smelling my wrists all day lol It has excellent lasting power also.The color changing bottle is cute.This is geared towards the younger crowd but I feel like any age could wear this fresh scent."

As my blue eyes blossom from its tender graze, it lingers softly, tantalizing my nostrils and putting the ‚Äúinner me‚Äù into a charming state of botanic tranquility.

Not only do I enjoy its invigorating suppleness, which caresses my skin and my hairline, I close my eyes and the uplifting aroma causes my subconscious to unwind. This is my new heavenly scent now!!"

B0BQF29FLQ,SmartShopperQT,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Smells Great But Too Light,All of these small perfumes smell like a breath of fresh air. It‚Äôs like nature has hit me but with sweetness. My favorite scent was Happy AF because I feel like it smelled the freshest and cleanest out of the bunch. I could also smell it on my mom from a distance away unlike the other scents. Hyped AF smelled like a mandarin that was a bit toned down and it still had a light scent. It couldn‚Äôt be smelled unless I shoved my arm into someone‚Äôs face and I found that a bit unfortunate. Chill AF smelled sweet but really was the best in capturing a woody scent out of all the perfumes in the box. It had that small spicy smell to it. It was a great blend that captured lots of sweetness but maintained the spicy side. The smell of the scents didn‚Äôt last long and I probably wouldn‚Äôt purchase them because of how light they were. I like wearing things for other people to take notice of the smell and enjoy the smell of it with me. I also felt like the sprayer could‚Äôve been better. It was much too liquid-like and didn‚Äôt have much of a mist when coming out onto the skin. There was a few times the liquid would run down my arm because of how watery it was. I liked each of the scents but they didn‚Äôt really stand out to me.
B0BQF29FLQ,HAMZA,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2023",Smells Great But‚Ä¶,"Smells great but sadly it doesn‚Äôt last long. Love how the bottle is like a mood ring kind of vibe, if you press down on the bottle itself it changes colors. Very unique, and creative."

B0BQF29FLQ,Lisa,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2023",Pretty decent scents,"Honestly for this being another ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù fragrance I didn‚Äôt think they were too bad. The names are extremely cringy ‚Äúaf‚Äù, but the scents make up for it. This is just a sample kit so you get to try out the 3 scents and use the bottle as a travel version. The three have their own scents that are pretty distinct from each other.

They all have a musky note to them but Hyped AF has a citrus scent, Happy AF is more floral, and Chill AF is more herbal like. My personal favorite is Hyped, it‚Äôs fresh, citrus, and fruity."
B0BQF29FLQ,Nothn4me,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2023",Clean Light Orange-Citrus Scent,"I tend to like light, fresh scents when it comes to perfume and I like this fragrance.

This perfume has a clean, orange-citrus scent that is light. It is described as ""woodsy citrus"" and truly does have a nice balance (not overly citrus-like). It isn't harsh and I was able to apply immediately after a shower (pores open and no stinging, etc.). The scent lasts for hours, but does fade by the end of an 8-hr day.

The bottle is a simple orange abstract shape that really aligns with the fragrance it holds (simple, not overpowering, with a hint of orange). The spray is even and application is sufficient.

I believe it is a good value for the price. It is more expensive than a body spray, but less expensive than a designer fragrance and that is fitting."

This is just a tester set. Each of the fragrances are .05 ounces. I like that the testers are the spray type. However, when I sprayed, I didn‚Äôt always get a mist. Sometimes, I just got drops of fragrance. So spray carefully.

HYPED - I really like the Hyped scent. It was my favorite of all three. This scent has very strong citrus notes which I love. [Listed as ‚Äúmandarin, nectarine blossom, clean musk.‚Äù]

HAPPY - was a little more floral. [Listed as ‚Äúrose, pink lychee, crystalized musk.‚Äù]

CHILL - was definitely a lemon with strong musky. [Listed as ‚Äúred lemongrass, lily of the valley, milky musk.‚Äù]

None of the scents lasted very long. From my experience, they are nice for an hour or two. I applied CHILL just a few hours ago and I can‚Äôt smell it at all anymore."
B0BQF29FLQ,HechoEnColorado,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2023",Scent Is Good. Lacking in Other Respects.,"I only marginally know who Addison Rae is, but I can definitively say I am not the target market for wearing this perfume. However, I enjoy new scents and have a fear of smelling like an old woman (brought on by my grandma, who wore the same stinky awful scent for years), so I decided to try this out.

This scent is very light and refreshing. It stays on for a bit, but it could certainly last longer. It needs to be reapplied throughout the day.

The bottle is cute, though a bit gimmicky (anyone remember Hypercolor from the early 90s?).

And though I'm not the target market for wearing this, I am certainly (as a middle-aged suburban mom) the target market for purchasing an item like this as a gift for a young woman. When considering the perfume from this aspect, I would point out that though I personally have a mouth like a trucker, it's a little tacky to have the ""AF"" in the name. If I were considering perfume as a gift for a teen girl, I'd probably go with something a little more classic."
B0BQF29FLQ,How'd That Pet Hair Get There,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2023",One Spray Lasts All Day,"The best way I would describe the perfume is that it's a very potent youthful floral aroma that would be best worn in well ventilated areas, and or during outdoor activities. I sprayed the perfume in the air, walked through it, and I kid you not, a week later I could still smell the perfume on my clothes when I went to do laundry. By no means did I go overboard when I sprayed it as I only did one click, but by the end of the day I had such a horrible headache. I still think it smells okay, but my senses were definitely overloaded."
B0BQF29FLQ,J. Shetrone,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2023",Light and fresh,This smells light and fresh and it's different than other perfumes I've had. The bright color of the bottle makes it easy to find on my dresser.

B0BQF29FLQ,Laura,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2023",Would make a good stocking Stuffer,"This would make a cute stocking stuffer and would give someone a chance to try three different perfumes. The samples are quite small but I do really like two of the perfumes. The chill af perfume is very musky and mysterious but still smells youthful. The hyped af smells florally and sweet and is definitely my favorite. The happy af perfume has a very strong citrusy smell which I do not like, literally smells like you are wearing oranges, not for me at all."
B0BQF29FLQ,KC,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023","Nice, light citrus scent","I tried this by spraying it on my arm and then periodically sniffing it through the day. It is a light, pleasant citrus type smell. You can definitely smell the mandarin/orange scent, but there is more to it than that too. It is a fairly light scent and wasn't overpowering to me and also didn't give me an instant headache, which is a huge plus because some perfumes bother me, but so far, this one hasn't. I didn't notice the scent as time went by, but if I sniffed my arm, the scent was still there. It is pleasant, though maybe not my personal favorite. I think most people who like an orange-type citrus scent will like it and it would make a nice gift."
B0BQF29FLQ,Saturnalia,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Super Citrus Scent But Wears Off Quickly,"I absolutely love trying new fragrances and this sounded perfect for summer. The bottle is super cool. It's completely yellow because it was really hot but it's hyper color like the shirts from the 90's and changes colors from dark orange to yellow when you hold it. It's not alcohol based so when you spritz it comes out in a stream instead of a mist. It does leave some oily residue behind. When you first spray the perfume you get hit strongly with the smell of the blood orange and nectarine. It's very, very orangey but that super strong citrus smell wears off quickly and leaves a light, pleasant orange and lemon smell. I was really hoping once the top notes wore off I would be left with the low, woodsy notes mentioned but I didn't smell any. After an hour I could barely smell it on my wrist. I will still use this for a fun, summer fragrance but it's not a fragrance I would purchase again. If you love the scent of strong, orange perfume this would be perfect for you but it's too one note for me. I prefer more complex fragrances that last longer than an hour."
B0BQF29FLQ,Jillian Schreck,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Color changing bottle,"I love this cute compact perfume bottle. The color changes with heat from your fingers which is a fun added bonus. The scent is very good, very musky but still tangerine. I didn‚Äôt think I would like it but it is very refreshing. My biggest complaint is that the smell just doesn‚Äôt seem to stick on me for some reason‚Ä¶I can smell it when I put it on but not much after at times. It is a very beautiful but faint smell. I appreciate the vibrancy of the packaging it is very suitable for the scent, two contrasting scents mixed but in a good way!"
B0BQF29FLQ,Unik,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Smells like pears üçê,"This is a very fruity fragrance that smells like a bowl of sweet candy. It‚Äôs very fruity/sweet but you can still grasp the floral aroma (although not as dominate). This comes off as a younger woman‚Äôs fragrance that would typical gravitate towards ‚Äútrendy‚Äù scents in similar price ranges.

The bottle design is very nice, better than a lot of others in this price range. It‚Äôs a matte bottle and cap that easily snaps open/close. I really like the bottle and it‚Äôs color design (maybe more than the fragrance itself). The fragrance overall is good, not a bad fragrance at all. It's too fruity for my preference but a lovely giftable item for the right person."

The scent is redolent of flowers with a delightful undertone of musky patchouli. I love spicy perfumes, not to sweet or flowery and not like the deep woods. This one is the perfect blend and does, indeed, spark a good mood.
If you are a sporty type who enjoys the outdoors and long walks in the woods or along a raging river you will love this fragrance."
B0BQF29FLQ,Miranda,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2023",Addison Rae Fragrance Set,"This Addison Rae fragrance set comes with 3 sample size fragrances or perfumes. Each fragrance smells good, but these sample bottles won't last very long. Included in this set are Hyped AF, Happy AF, and Chill AF. These would be good for travel or to keep in a purse or bag because they don't take up much space at all."
B0BQF29FLQ,N. J. LACROSS,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023","Soapy, clean and a bit juvenile.","This fragrance smells very youthful, soapy and inoffensive.
The presentation is overall rather cheap looking, with the bottle changing colors related to heat, which is the kind of gimmick I expect to be aimed towards a younger crowd.

I really liked the scent, it did stick around for a good 4-6 hours but it doesn't project super heavy or anything.

I could recommend this as a younger girls fragrance."
B0BQF29FLQ,Rnk,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Decent Ladies EDP,"Good edp for girls since its bit on sweeter smelling. It lasts around 4-6 hours, depending on your skin type it can vary. I think its bit on expensive side as well. Not disappointed but not very much happy with scent."
B0BQF29FLQ,Nu,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2023",Cute bottle,"This Hyped AF by Addison Rae Fragrance - Perfume for Women - Woody Citrus Scent - Opens with Mandarin and Blood Orange - Blended with Pomelo - For Confident, Driven Ladies - 1 oz EDP Spray, is first of all reasonably priced that $40. It has a refreshing scented fruity smell, which is not. I rarely use perfume in general, but I like this fragrance, and the bottle is changing color according to temperature."
B0BQF29FLQ,Stephanie C,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2023",Nice smell but,"The scent itself is not bad, that was one thing about this perfume i actually liked! But the bottle looks and feels pretty cheap, not to mention the scent doesn't last very long on the skin. Honesty, this acts more like a body spray than a perfume and I think the price should reflect that."
B0BQF29FLQ,John Greybeard,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023","Leaves a sticky residue on your skin, and it smells like orange juice","I don't know if I got a bad batch or not, but this stuff is horrible. It smells way too citrusy, and it leaves your skin feeling sticky. I'm starting to think they put orange juice in this stuff with as sticky as it is. The smell it leaves after it sits a while isn't so bad, but my wife had to wash her arms because of how it felt on her skin. I consider myself a perfume/cologne connoisseur, and we've had everything from budget brands at the dollar store to brands as expensive as Creed, so I'd classify this as a something you'd probably buy at Walmart for a teenage girl. I did want to give this at least 3 stars, because it does have a unique smell after sitting for a while. but it's definitely not a perfume for a 37 year old woman. If it weren't so sticky I'd have bumped it up to 4 stars. As far as my recommendations for improvements, I'd drop the price to about $20 and label it for teenagers, then get the formula fixed so it isn't so sticky."
B0BQF29FLQ,cvcduty,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2023",Pleasant scent,"This is a nice perfume.
I gave it to my wife and I must say that I find the scent pleasant.
It does not feel overwhelming and overpowering.
The bottle seems neat as well.
Overall, happy with this product."
B0BQF29FLQ,Jonathan C,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2023",Orange cream soda,"The scent is orange essential oil with a hint of lemon mint and cream soda. It is delicious and smells natural.

The ingredients list is short which suggests Addison made an effort to reduce toxic chemicals typical in almost all conventional perfumes.

For an EDP, it doesn't last very long. When your primary fragrance is essential oils, the scent only lasts a couple of hours at most.

My daughter absolutely loves it."
B0BQF29FLQ,Tom,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023","nice and fresh, but doesn't last long","This smells citrucy and fresh in the beginning, but due to the lack of heavy bottom notes, the effect doesn't last long. Citrucy top notes evaporate within 2-3 hours, and this is no different for this perfume. This is somewhat of a disappointment for a perfume, but also expected from its composition with plenty of citrucy top notes.
Also, about 15-20 minutes after the application, there is a distinct take over of lemon, which unfortunately makes it transiently smell a bit like 'lemon-fresh' scents of various household products."
B0BQF29FLQ,Ma'ama,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Sweet floral and fruity fragrance for older kids and teens.,This has a fruity floral fragrance that smells sweet and youthful. I like how the bottle changes from purple to pink when I touch it. This fragrance doesn‚Äôt last all day and needs to be reapplied to keep the scent going. This is most suitable for preteens and teens. My 8 year old daughter loves this scent.
B0BQF29FLQ,Miss Pink Lemonade,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Little Samples that Help You Determine if You Would Like the Full-Size Version ...,"These three samples are the type you might get with a purchase at a cosmetics/fragrance counter or even at a cosmetics/fragrance shop. The vials are typical sample size and instead of a mist, it comes out as a fast stream (so go easy here).

Sure, it's a little gimmicky, but there is some silly fun here as well. ""Hyped"" is an overall good scent: it's a little like Tocca Stella, but a little less nuanced and layered. Now, ""Happy"" is genuinely cheery. There almost seem to be sugary notes here. It's a more layered scent that translates as simple and pretty. And ""Chill"" is a little basic but in a good way. The Lilly of the Valley really sings here. All fragrances have musk as their base (or ""bottom"" note).

Since these fragrances are not sold in my area, this was a good way to sample them to see if I wished to order the full-sized versions."
B0BQF29FLQ,ThePlainOldT,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023","Very understated, but ""pretty"" fragrances.","This Addison Rae Fragrance by Addison Rae Fragrance is a nicely packaged set of three sample size fragrances. I'm not that fond of the names, but each one smells very much of the notes listed.
My favorites are Chill and Hyped. Happy is floral, which is okay, but florals are not my favorites. All of the fragrances are very understated, but ""pretty"" smelling. I have to put my nose right up to my wrists to smell them.
This sampler set is a nice way to pick your new favorite perfume from this brand, and I would recommend it."
B0BQF29FLQ,Carrie,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023",Scent doesn‚Äôt last long,"This perfume is very tangerine/citrusy smelling. It‚Äôs nice, but I was hoping for more of the woody scent in the description. It didn‚Äôt seem to last very long."
B0BQF29FLQ,Iris Insights,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023",Not strong or long lasting,These are very tiny samples. The perfumes smell nice but I didn‚Äôt find them to be very strong scents and I couldn‚Äôt really smell them on myself or get a whiff of the scent while wearing it.
B0BQF29FLQ,Joshua Vittachi,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2023",So nice!,"I was skeptical because I‚Äôm not a huge floral scent person but this is so subtle and soft of a fragrance but yet still so inviting that it has become my new favorite! And the glass bottle that it is in is heat sensitive so when you touch it, it changes colors which is super fun. Very giftable or even to keep for yourself. Will last me a long while. Love!! -wife‚Äôs review"
B0BQF29FLQ,OptimusPrime,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023",Accurately named,"Happy AF is very appropriately named. When I spray it on I get an immediate mood lift. The bottle is so unique and quirky as it changes colors with the heat of your hands. The scent is a fun, fruity floral that is so uplifting and beautiful. It lasts 2-3 hours on me but I don‚Äôt mind reapplying it several times a day to get another boost of happy!"
B0BQF29FLQ,P J,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2023",Love this!!,"Ok I'm not a big perfume person, generally don't wear perfume but I really like this one!! I generally don't wear any because I have kids that have asthma and a lot of strong smells interfere with it but I can put this one on and go right by them and it don't bother them at all!! That's a big bonus in my book!!!! It has a light scent to it just with one squirt. I'm sure it would be stronger with more but that is all I need."
B0BQF29FLQ,mama Ruggles,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023","Nice scent, poor delivery"," The smell of this is light, I definitely feel like it's a younger scent, but I would be comfortable wearing it as an older person too. Perfume is really subjective so difficult to review- but it's not a horrible smell. The bottle is cute, but the spray really comes out a stream."
B0BQF29FLQ,C. Cowles,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Cute sampler,"This comes as a set of three tiny spray samples to test out the three fragrances by Addison Rae. All three smell good. I just wish they lasted longer as they start to fade after a couple hours and I prefer perfumes with longevity. If you don't mind having to reapply ever so often, the floral/fruit and musky scents are great for summer."
B0BQF29FLQ,Just some person,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023",Happy scent in a unique bottle,"I love the smell. It's not too weak and also not overpowering. I spray it on my clothes and it has decent staying power throughout the day.
I forget what the fragrance notes are ""supposed"" to be, but my personal interpretation after just spraying a few minutes ago is citrus, grape, and rose.
Also I have to mention the very interesting bottle. I love it. It's an odd pebble shape covered with a heat-sensitive color changing paint. It's very creative and a joy to the senses.
Overall, I definitely recommend this fragrance if you like bright joyful scents and very unique packaging."
B0BQF29FLQ,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023",a new favorite?,"I got the hyped and chill AF perfumes
Both smell awesome! The hyped is an orange citrus clean scent that just smells like summer in a bottle. The chill is a light floral sandalwood beach smell, both scents are light and not over powering and smell great! They last a good while too. The bottles are also interesting and different, they are VIBRANT, and they change color to touch.
Would be a great gift for a teenager or young adult"
B0BQF29FLQ,Fashionista Gal,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023",Beautiful fun HAPPY perfume! No alcohol formula makes it spectacular!,"This is delicious and fun as a perfume. I love light citrus florals so this is spot on. I smelled it and said it reminded me of the Happy we know from that cosmetic line, but this is more complex, not a straight citrus but mixed delightfully with rose, peony, and other complimentary ingredients. I love that there is no alcohol and it is a water based product. There is no alcohol tone to the fragrance, with the bright notes popping first. I feel the fragrance lasts a long time, and, at first I did t think one squirt was enough, and added another, and I think it takes a minute for the perfume to hit the skin and start to offer more aroma.

The bottle is really unique too. It changes colors with the heat from touch. My photo doesn‚Äôt show very well, as I‚Äôm in an air conditioned room but this bottle will turn pink if held for long. It‚Äôs fun and I will enjoy putting it out on my dresser. I don‚Äôt often buy perfume, and this feels like a department store line. It‚Äôs certainly impressing me more than most fancy ones. The lack of alcohol as the carrier ingredient makes a huge difference, and the fragrance is sooo much better for it.

This would make a perfect gift, it‚Äôs a lot of fun, and smells good enough I‚Äôll remember to wear it !!! Recommend!!!! Love love it."
B0BQF29FLQ,Bob & Claire,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2023",Flowery Citrus Scent in a Color Changing Bottle,"First off, the bottle is cool. Reminds me to a mood ring in that the bottle changes based on temperature. I feel that is a nice added touch. The fragrance itself is a fruity floral light scent. The scent lasted for about 4 to 6 hours which is good to get through the day."
B0BQF29FLQ,B Harvey,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2023",Smells great on women in my opinion,"I got this for a woman in my life and she loves to wear it. I think it smells great, but I don't know enough about scents to know how to describe it. I guess the main thing I think of when I smell it is clean, it smells like someone just got out of a nice bath with scented oils in it or something to me.

The bottle it's in is cool, it changes colors where it heats up, so basically when you're holding it your fingers can change its colors. The way it's packaged makes it a great gift, too. All in all this is a good buy and for the price you get a great scent in a bottle that is very cool to see on the shelf."
B0BQF29FLQ,Just my 2 sense of things,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2023",nice Citrus note,at first wife was not a fan I liked it tho sweet Citrus but as soon as she spray it on her body it changes and she loved it it's Long lasting too after a long day I can Still smell it on her very well
B0BQF29FLQ,Patricia Evans,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Surprisingly light,"Several interesting things - it smells great first of all.
It reminds me more of essential oils put together in the just right blend. They feel is like that too - so I'll say that if you put on a lot, you'll feel a teeny bit of oil residue on the skin. But it takes a lot. Some of that is because it has good ingredients.
Next was even with adding more it smelled even better but didn't overwhelm my senses - didn't give me a headache like some perfumes can.
And it smelled different at different points - at first you could smell some of the spicy and some of the bergamot notes, then it shifts to lighter more floral with the lily of the valley and pear blossom.
I really enjoy the scent and found myself delighted in wearing it.
Last thing - the top of the bottle - is heat sensitive. So I couldn't help myself and tried to make patterns just holding it. Neat addition to an already nice product."
B0BQF29FLQ,Dawn Wenner,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2023",Memorable scent,"First thing is the bottle. It is just fun no matter what your age. Every time you touch it, it is a different color. But the smell is fabulous and doesn‚Äôt smell like just another strong perfume. I do not like floral scent of any kind but this doesn‚Äôt give that to me. I am not good at identifying different notes and know that I like a musky scent. This will be my scent for a while as it doesn‚Äôt take much of the spray to attract my attention. It is not overpowering but one squirt in plenty."
B0BQF29FLQ,Michele the Elf,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023",Smells like oranges,"I think that this smells mostly like oranges. There are some other notes to it that are nice. The smell is all right if you like this kind of scent. As long as you use a little, it isn't overpowering. It did not give me a headache. My biggest issue with it was that it felt weird on my skin. I could feel where I had sprayed it even after it dried. It felt almost sticky. It does wash off easily with soap and water. I'm not a fan of it on my skin but I'll still use it on occasion by spraying a bit on my clothing."
B0BQF29FLQ,L&S,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Costly for the size but has great subtle citrus scent,"Honestly, this product is a bit pricey at $40.00 base cost. The description states it has a woody citrus scent, but I was only able to.smell the citrus scent and nothing woody. I would presume the woody scent was suppose to be almost like a musky wood fragrance. The citrus scent is pleasant and it's very subtle and not one of those overpowering smells.

This bottle of perfume would work great for a person who can't stand to use fragrances that are too strong, over powering. As noted, it is a very subtle fragrance and smells like citrus."
B0BQF29FLQ,RN,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2023",Good gift for a teen,"I don't have the scent vocabulary to describe this well. It's flowery and musky at the same time. It's a nice scent. My wife doesn't love it or hate it, but our daughter likes it quite a bit.

The bottle is fun. It changes color like a mood ring. It's a gimmick, but people like gimmicks.

This would make a good gift for a teen."
B0BQF29FLQ,C. L,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023",Great little sampler set,"This Addison Rae Fragrance Set by Addison Rae Fragrance is 3 fragrance samplers in a cardboard sleeve, it arrives inside a bubble wrap bag.

The sampler set allows you to experience all 3 fragrances to see if you like them before committing to a large bottle. I'm not a frequent fragrance wearer so these samplers are perfect for me, I get to try multiple scents for one low price and a sampler is generally enough for the special occasions where I would use a fragrance. The small size is also ideal when traveling.

I was surprised my favorite was CHILL AF, it has a very clean smell. I did not like HAPPY AF as much, it was too floral for me. The HYPED AF was okay, I really could smell the mandarin and nectarine in it."
B0BQF29FLQ,Jam,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2023",Doesn‚Äôt last long.,"The longevity of this fragrance is pretty weak. I stop smelling it within an hour of putting it on. The scent is somewhat reminiscent of the b&bw 90s scent pearberry. It is definitely a tween perfume. The component is cool, but I don‚Äôt think that this perfume is really worth the 40.00 price point."
B0BQF29FLQ,Aegiscrash,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2023",Great Sampler Set,"This is a small sample of three different Eau de Parfum (EDP) from Addison Rae. Chill and Happy are both great scents, i can see these for day or evening wear. Overall safe scents. Hyped is just a bit too much lemon, its not offensive but just too strong in the one scent profile. Great buy if you wanna try before buy to a larger purchase."

The perfume smells AMAZING (I‚Äôm SO sensitive and picky with scents!) so I was still going to rate it highly since that‚Äôs the most important aspect of course. Took it back out of the pretty box to take photos and it was purple and blue!
Realization dawned on me and I held it in the freezer air for just a moment and watched it turn completely purple‚Ä¶ except for where my warm fingers were touching it. üòÑüòçüíôüíúüíô

Overall it is a pleasing scent and my husband liked it. Very young and fresh feeling. The bottle fits in your hand very well and has a very neat color changing feature where the bottle changes color where you touch it.

I wasn't a fan of the formatting on the box. They way they used a justified paragraph setting made the packaging look cheap. Should have just centered. The way it is now gives it a knock off/off brand feel IMO.

The product itself inside feels very high end, just wish box looked better."
B0BQF29FLQ,Veronica B,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",LOVE this sampler pack!!,"I love sampler packs like this that let you try different scents out prior to ordering a full size! Especially at this price (5.99 at time of review), you really do get to sample them out. Although they are small, you only need a few sprays. I spray 1 spritz on my wrist and 1 on my neck and it stayed with me for a while! So the small samples will last a little bit!

They all smell amazing!! Chill AF is probably my favorite, but they really all do smell really really good! Definitely going to be ordering a full size bottle of the Chill AF (and the full sized bottles look adorable)!! Super happy with these perfumes!!"
B0BQF29FLQ,Dingle Girl,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2023",Lovely scent,"I am so pleased with Chill AF by Addison Rae.

I rarely get any compliments on other perfumes that I‚Äôve had on but this one, people have actually asked what I‚Äôm wearing. It‚Äôs a great scent.

They all smell really good and fresh. Chill af is my favorite its a light fresh scent with no extra scents added.

I did notice a light stickiness after use but it wasn't enough to make me not like it, maybe due to an ingredient?
I would buy all of these perfumes in a large size."

Also the bottle that it comes in is a very unique and cool design as well. Easy five stars."

It's one of those perfumes that had me smelling my wrists all day lol It has excellent lasting power also.The color changing bottle is cute.This is geared towards the younger crowd but I feel like any age could wear this fresh scent."

Just a spritz in the air and the way its fruity presence touches my neckline, makes my heartbeat flutter with pure exuberance. As my blue eyes blossom from its tender graze, it lingers softly, tantalizing my nostrils and putting the ‚Äúinner me‚Äù into a charming state of botanic tranquility.

Not only do I enjoy its invigorating suppleness, which caresses my skin and my hairline, I close my eyes and the uplifting aroma causes my subconscious to unwind. This is my new heavenly scent now!!"

They smell pretty good, though not exactly my normal style. I will say that they don‚Äôt spray very well, like in a mist. They spray out all at once, so that is the main thing that I don‚Äôt like about this. However, if you want to try a new perfume this is great because you have three different smells centered around different moods. Definitely recommend!"
B0BSRD9WNV,Jessica,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2023",Lasts about 2-3 hours,"I like the scent of this, it's a little fruity but not too much where it feels juvenile.

B0BSRD9WNV,SmartShopperQT,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Smells Great But Too Light,All of these small perfumes smell like a breath of fresh air. It‚Äôs like nature has hit me but with sweetness. My favorite scent was Happy AF because I feel like it smelled the freshest and cleanest out of the bunch. I could also smell it on my mom from a distance away unlike the other scents. Hyped AF smelled like a mandarin that was a bit toned down and it still had a light scent. It couldn‚Äôt be smelled unless I shoved my arm into someone‚Äôs face and I found that a bit unfortunate. Chill AF smelled sweet but really was the best in capturing a woody scent out of all the perfumes in the box. It had that small spicy smell to it. It was a great blend that captured lots of sweetness but maintained the spicy side. The smell of the scents didn‚Äôt last long and I probably wouldn‚Äôt purchase them because of how light they were. I like wearing things for other people to take notice of the smell and enjoy the smell of it with me. I also felt like the sprayer could‚Äôve been better. It was much too liquid-like and didn‚Äôt have much of a mist when coming out onto the skin. There was a few times the liquid would run down my arm because of how watery it was. I liked each of the scents but they didn‚Äôt really stand out to me.
B0BSRD9WNV,HAMZA,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2023",Smells Great But‚Ä¶,"Smells great but sadly it doesn‚Äôt last long. Love how the bottle is like a mood ring kind of vibe, if you press down on the bottle itself it changes colors. Very unique, and creative."

B0BSRD9WNV,Lisa,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2023",Pretty decent scents,"Honestly for this being another ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù fragrance I didn‚Äôt think they were too bad. The names are extremely cringy ‚Äúaf‚Äù, but the scents make up for it. This is just a sample kit so you get to try out the 3 scents and use the bottle as a travel version. The three have their own scents that are pretty distinct from each other.

They all have a musky note to them but Hyped AF has a citrus scent, Happy AF is more floral, and Chill AF is more herbal like. My personal favorite is Hyped, it‚Äôs fresh, citrus, and fruity."
B0BSRD9WNV,Nothn4me,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2023",Clean Light Orange-Citrus Scent,"I tend to like light, fresh scents when it comes to perfume and I like this fragrance.

This perfume has a clean, orange-citrus scent that is light. It is described as ""woodsy citrus"" and truly does have a nice balance (not overly citrus-like). It isn't harsh and I was able to apply immediately after a shower (pores open and no stinging, etc.). The scent lasts for hours, but does fade by the end of an 8-hr day.

The bottle is a simple orange abstract shape that really aligns with the fragrance it holds (simple, not overpowering, with a hint of orange). The spray is even and application is sufficient.

I believe it is a good value for the price. It is more expensive than a body spray, but less expensive than a designer fragrance and that is fitting."
B0BSRD9WNV,Bluebooks,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023",Really like the citrus notes in HYPED. None of the fragrances lasted very long.,"This is a review of ‚ÄúAddison Rae Fragrance Set by Addison Rae Fragrance - 3 pc Gift Set.‚Äù

This is just a tester set. Each of the fragrances are .05 ounces. I like that the testers are the spray type. However, when I sprayed, I didn‚Äôt always get a mist. Sometimes, I just got drops of fragrance. So spray carefully.

HYPED - I really like the Hyped scent. It was my favorite of all three. This scent has very strong citrus notes which I love. [Listed as ‚Äúmandarin, nectarine blossom, clean musk.‚Äù]

HAPPY - was a little more floral. [Listed as ‚Äúrose, pink lychee, crystalized musk.‚Äù]

CHILL - was definitely a lemon with strong musky. [Listed as ‚Äúred lemongrass, lily of the valley, milky musk.‚Äù]

None of the scents lasted very long. From my experience, they are nice for an hour or two. I applied CHILL just a few hours ago and I can‚Äôt smell it at all anymore."
B0BSRD9WNV,HechoEnColorado,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2023",Scent Is Good. Lacking in Other Respects.,"I only marginally know who Addison Rae is, but I can definitively say I am not the target market for wearing this perfume. However, I enjoy new scents and have a fear of smelling like an old woman (brought on by my grandma, who wore the same stinky awful scent for years), so I decided to try this out.

This scent is very light and refreshing. It stays on for a bit, but it could certainly last longer. It needs to be reapplied throughout the day.

The bottle is cute, though a bit gimmicky (anyone remember Hypercolor from the early 90s?).

And though I'm not the target market for wearing this, I am certainly (as a middle-aged suburban mom) the target market for purchasing an item like this as a gift for a young woman. When considering the perfume from this aspect, I would point out that though I personally have a mouth like a trucker, it's a little tacky to have the ""AF"" in the name. If I were considering perfume as a gift for a teen girl, I'd probably go with something a little more classic."
B0BSRD9WNV,How'd That Pet Hair Get There,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2023",One Spray Lasts All Day,"The best way I would describe the perfume is that it's a very potent youthful floral aroma that would be best worn in well ventilated areas, and or during outdoor activities. I sprayed the perfume in the air, walked through it, and I kid you not, a week later I could still smell the perfume on my clothes when I went to do laundry. By no means did I go overboard when I sprayed it as I only did one click, but by the end of the day I had such a horrible headache. I still think it smells okay, but my senses were definitely overloaded."
B0BSRD9WNV,J. Shetrone,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2023",Light and fresh,This smells light and fresh and it's different than other perfumes I've had. The bright color of the bottle makes it easy to find on my dresser.

As good as the scent smells it's a bit girly scented like for someone young. The scent isn't as strong but fruity and light. Smells like apples, pears and flowers. The scent is long lasting. The Addison Rae collection has other scents."
B0BSRD9WNV,Laura,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2023",Would make a good stocking Stuffer,"This would make a cute stocking stuffer and would give someone a chance to try three different perfumes. The samples are quite small but I do really like two of the perfumes. The chill af perfume is very musky and mysterious but still smells youthful. The hyped af smells florally and sweet and is definitely my favorite. The happy af perfume has a very strong citrusy smell which I do not like, literally smells like you are wearing oranges, not for me at all."
B0BSRD9WNV,KC,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023","Nice, light citrus scent","I tried this by spraying it on my arm and then periodically sniffing it through the day. It is a light, pleasant citrus type smell. You can definitely smell the mandarin/orange scent, but there is more to it than that too. It is a fairly light scent and wasn't overpowering to me and also didn't give me an instant headache, which is a huge plus because some perfumes bother me, but so far, this one hasn't. I didn't notice the scent as time went by, but if I sniffed my arm, the scent was still there. It is pleasant, though maybe not my personal favorite. I think most people who like an orange-type citrus scent will like it and it would make a nice gift."
B0BSRD9WNV,Saturnalia,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Super Citrus Scent But Wears Off Quickly,"I absolutely love trying new fragrances and this sounded perfect for summer. The bottle is super cool. It's completely yellow because it was really hot but it's hyper color like the shirts from the 90's and changes colors from dark orange to yellow when you hold it. It's not alcohol based so when you spritz it comes out in a stream instead of a mist. It does leave some oily residue behind. When you first spray the perfume you get hit strongly with the smell of the blood orange and nectarine. It's very, very orangey but that super strong citrus smell wears off quickly and leaves a light, pleasant orange and lemon smell. I was really hoping once the top notes wore off I would be left with the low, woodsy notes mentioned but I didn't smell any. After an hour I could barely smell it on my wrist. I will still use this for a fun, summer fragrance but it's not a fragrance I would purchase again. If you love the scent of strong, orange perfume this would be perfect for you but it's too one note for me. I prefer more complex fragrances that last longer than an hour."
B0BSRD9WNV,Jillian Schreck,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Color changing bottle,"I love this cute compact perfume bottle. The color changes with heat from your fingers which is a fun added bonus. The scent is very good, very musky but still tangerine. I didn‚Äôt think I would like it but it is very refreshing. My biggest complaint is that the smell just doesn‚Äôt seem to stick on me for some reason‚Ä¶I can smell it when I put it on but not much after at times. It is a very beautiful but faint smell. I appreciate the vibrancy of the packaging it is very suitable for the scent, two contrasting scents mixed but in a good way!"
B0BSRD9WNV,Unik,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Smells like pears üçê,"This is a very fruity fragrance that smells like a bowl of sweet candy. It‚Äôs very fruity/sweet but you can still grasp the floral aroma (although not as dominate). This comes off as a younger woman‚Äôs fragrance that would typical gravitate towards ‚Äútrendy‚Äù scents in similar price ranges.

The bottle design is very nice, better than a lot of others in this price range. It‚Äôs a matte bottle and cap that easily snaps open/close. I really like the bottle and it‚Äôs color design (maybe more than the fragrance itself). The fragrance overall is good, not a bad fragrance at all. It's too fruity for my preference but a lovely giftable item for the right person."
B0BSRD9WNV,K. Peterson,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2023",Smell Delicious,"My bottle arrived yesterday and two things seemed wonderful, the spicy perfume and the color changing bottle (it arrived a bright pink and was soon blueish purple).
The scent is redolent of flowers with a delightful undertone of musky patchouli. I love spicy perfumes, not to sweet or flowery and not like the deep woods. This one is the perfect blend and does, indeed, spark a good mood.
If you are a sporty type who enjoys the outdoors and long walks in the woods or along a raging river you will love this fragrance."

B0BSRD9WNV,N. J. LACROSS,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023","Soapy, clean and a bit juvenile.","This fragrance smells very youthful, soapy and inoffensive.
The presentation is overall rather cheap looking, with the bottle changing colors related to heat, which is the kind of gimmick I expect to be aimed towards a younger crowd.

I really liked the scent, it did stick around for a good 4-6 hours but it doesn't project super heavy or anything.

I could recommend this as a younger girls fragrance."
B0BSRD9WNV,Rnk,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Decent Ladies EDP,"Good edp for girls since its bit on sweeter smelling.

B0BSRD9WNV,Stephanie C,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2023",Nice smell but,"The scent itself is not bad, that was one thing about this perfume i actually liked! But the bottle looks and feels pretty cheap, not to mention the scent doesn't last very long on the skin. Honesty, this acts more like a body spray than a perfume and I think the price should reflect that."
B0BSRD9WNV,John Greybeard,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023","Leaves a sticky residue on your skin, and it smells like orange juice","I don't know if I got a bad batch or not, but this stuff is horrible. It smells way too citrusy, and it leaves your skin feeling sticky. I'm starting to think they put orange juice in this stuff with as sticky as it is. The smell it leaves after it sits a while isn't so bad, but my wife had to wash her arms because of how it felt on her skin. I consider myself a perfume/cologne connoisseur, and we've had everything from budget brands at the dollar store to brands as expensive as Creed, so I'd classify this as a something you'd probably buy at Walmart for a teenage girl. I did want to give this at least 3 stars, because it does have a unique smell after sitting for a while. but it's definitely not a perfume for a 37 year old woman. If it weren't so sticky I'd have bumped it up to 4 stars. As far as my recommendations for improvements, I'd drop the price to about $20 and label it for teenagers, then get the formula fixed so it isn't so sticky."
B0BSRD9WNV,cvcduty,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2023",Pleasant scent,"This is a nice perfume.
I gave it to my wife and I must say that I find the scent pleasant.

B0BSRD9WNV,Jonathan C,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2023",Orange cream soda,"The scent is orange essential oil with a hint of lemon mint and cream soda. It is delicious and smells natural.

The ingredients list is short which suggests Addison made an effort to reduce toxic chemicals typical in almost all conventional perfumes.

For an EDP, it doesn't last very long. When your primary fragrance is essential oils, the scent only lasts a couple of hours at most.

My daughter absolutely loves it."
B0BSRD9WNV,Tom,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023","nice and fresh, but doesn't last long","This smells citrucy and fresh in the beginning, but due to the lack of heavy bottom notes, the effect doesn't last long. Citrucy top notes evaporate within 2-3 hours, and this is no different for this perfume. This is somewhat of a disappointment for a perfume, but also expected from its composition with plenty of citrucy top notes.
Also, about 15-20 minutes after the application, there is a distinct take over of lemon, which unfortunately makes it transiently smell a bit like 'lemon-fresh' scents of various household products."
B0BSRD9WNV,Ma'ama,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Sweet floral and fruity fragrance for older kids and teens.,This has a fruity floral fragrance that smells sweet and youthful.

This is most suitable for preteens and teens. My 8 year old daughter loves this scent.
B0BSRD9WNV,Miss Pink Lemonade,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Little Samples that Help You Determine if You Would Like the Full-Size Version ...,"These three samples are the type you might get with a purchase at a cosmetics/fragrance counter or even at a cosmetics/fragrance shop. The vials are typical sample size and instead of a mist, it comes out as a fast stream (so go easy here).

Sure, it's a little gimmicky, but there is some silly fun here as well. ""Hyped"" is an overall good scent: it's a little like Tocca Stella, but a little less nuanced and layered. Now, ""Happy"" is genuinely cheery. There almost seem to be sugary notes here. It's a more layered scent that translates as simple and pretty. And ""Chill"" is a little basic but in a good way. The Lilly of the Valley really sings here. All fragrances have musk as their base (or ""bottom"" note).

Since these fragrances are not sold in my area, this was a good way to sample them to see if I wished to order the full-sized versions."
B0BSRD9WNV,ThePlainOldT,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023","Very understated, but ""pretty"" fragrances.","This Addison Rae Fragrance by Addison Rae Fragrance is a nicely packaged set of three sample size fragrances. I'm not that fond of the names, but each one smells very much of the notes listed.
My favorites are Chill and Hyped. Happy is floral, which is okay, but florals are not my favorites. All of the fragrances are very understated, but ""pretty"" smelling. I have to put my nose right up to my wrists to smell them.
This sampler set is a nice way to pick your new favorite perfume from this brand, and I would recommend it."

I generally don't wear any because I have kids that have asthma and a lot of strong smells interfere with it but I can put this one on and go right by them and it don't bother them at all!! That's a big bonus in my book!!!! It has a light scent to it just with one squirt. I'm sure it would be stronger with more but that is all I need."

I forget what the fragrance notes are ""supposed"" to be, but my personal interpretation after just spraying a few minutes ago is citrus, grape, and rose.
Also I have to mention the very interesting bottle. I love it. It's an odd pebble shape covered with a heat-sensitive color changing paint. It's very creative and a joy to the senses.
Overall, I definitely recommend this fragrance if you like bright joyful scents and very unique packaging."

I love light citrus florals so this is spot on. I smelled it and said it reminded me of the Happy we know from that cosmetic line, but this is more complex, not a straight citrus but mixed delightfully with rose, peony, and other complimentary ingredients. I love that there is no alcohol and it is a water based product. There is no alcohol tone to the fragrance, with the bright notes popping first. I feel the fragrance lasts a long time, and, at first I did t think one squirt was enough, and added another, and I think it takes a minute for the perfume to hit the skin and start to offer more aroma.

The bottle is really unique too. It changes colors with the heat from touch. My photo doesn‚Äôt show very well, as I‚Äôm in an air conditioned room but this bottle will turn pink if held for long. It‚Äôs fun and I will enjoy putting it out on my dresser. I don‚Äôt often buy perfume, and this feels like a department store line. It‚Äôs certainly impressing me more than most fancy ones. The lack of alcohol as the carrier ingredient makes a huge difference, and the fragrance is sooo much better for it.

This would make a perfect gift, it‚Äôs a lot of fun, and smells good enough I‚Äôll remember to wear it !!! Recommend!!!! Love love it."
B0BSRD9WNV,Bob & Claire,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2023",Flowery Citrus Scent in a Color Changing Bottle,"First off, the bottle is cool. Reminds me to a mood ring in that the bottle changes based on temperature. I feel that is a nice added touch. The fragrance itself is a fruity floral light scent. The scent lasted for about 4 to 6 hours which is good to get through the day."
B0BSRD9WNV,B Harvey,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2023",Smells great on women in my opinion,"I got this for a woman in my life and she loves to wear it. I think it smells great, but I don't know enough about scents to know how to describe it. I guess the main thing I think of when I smell it is clean, it smells like someone just got out of a nice bath with scented oils in it or something to me.

The bottle it's in is cool, it changes colors where it heats up, so basically when you're holding it your fingers can change its colors. The way it's packaged makes it a great gift, too. All in all this is a good buy and for the price you get a great scent in a bottle that is very cool to see on the shelf."
B0BSRD9WNV,Just my 2 sense of things,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2023",nice Citrus note,at first wife was not a fan I liked it tho sweet Citrus but as soon as she spray it on her body it changes and she loved it it's Long lasting too after a long day I can Still smell it on her very well
B0BSRD9WNV,Patricia Evans,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Surprisingly light,"Several interesting things - it smells great first of all.
It reminds me more of essential oils put together in the just right blend. They feel is like that too - so I'll say that if you put on a lot, you'll feel a teeny bit of oil residue on the skin. But it takes a lot. Some of that is because it has good ingredients.
Next was even with adding more it smelled even better but didn't overwhelm my senses - didn't give me a headache like some perfumes can.
And it smelled different at different points - at first you could smell some of the spicy and some of the bergamot notes, then it shifts to lighter more floral with the lily of the valley and pear blossom.
I really enjoy the scent and found myself delighted in wearing it.
Last thing - the top of the bottle - is heat sensitive. So I couldn't help myself and tried to make patterns just holding it. Neat addition to an already nice product."
B0BSRD9WNV,Dawn Wenner,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2023",Memorable scent,"First thing is the bottle. It is just fun no matter what your age. Every time you touch it, it is a different color. But the smell is fabulous and doesn‚Äôt smell like just another strong perfume. I do not like floral scent of any kind but this doesn‚Äôt give that to me. I am not good at identifying different notes and know that I like a musky scent. This will be my scent for a while as it doesn‚Äôt take much of the spray to attract my attention. It is not overpowering but one squirt in plenty."
B0BSRD9WNV,Michele the Elf,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023",Smells like oranges,"I think that this smells mostly like oranges. There are some other notes to it that are nice. The smell is all right if you like this kind of scent. As long as you use a little, it isn't overpowering. It did not give me a headache. My biggest issue with it was that it felt weird on my skin. I could feel where I had sprayed it even after it dried. It felt almost sticky. It does wash off easily with soap and water. I'm not a fan of it on my skin but I'll still use it on occasion by spraying a bit on my clothing."
B0BSRD9WNV,L&S,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",Costly for the size but has great subtle citrus scent,"Honestly, this product is a bit pricey at $40.00 base cost. The description states it has a woody citrus scent, but I was only able to.smell the citrus scent and nothing woody. I would presume the woody scent was suppose to be almost like a musky wood fragrance. The citrus scent is pleasant and it's very subtle and not one of those overpowering smells.

This bottle of perfume would work great for a person who can't stand to use fragrances that are too strong, over powering. As noted, it is a very subtle fragrance and smells like citrus."
B0BSRD9WNV,RN,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2023",Good gift for a teen,"I don't have the scent vocabulary to describe this well. It's flowery and musky at the same time. It's a nice scent. My wife doesn't love it or hate it, but our daughter likes it quite a bit.

The bottle is fun. It changes color like a mood ring. It's a gimmick, but people like gimmicks.

This would make a good gift for a teen."
B0BSRD9WNV,C. L,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023",Great little sampler set,"This Addison Rae Fragrance Set by Addison Rae Fragrance is 3 fragrance samplers in a cardboard sleeve, it arrives inside a bubble wrap bag.

The sampler set allows you to experience all 3 fragrances to see if you like them before committing to a large bottle. I'm not a frequent fragrance wearer so these samplers are perfect for me, I get to try multiple scents for one low price and a sampler is generally enough for the special occasions where I would use a fragrance. The small size is also ideal when traveling.

I was surprised my favorite was CHILL AF, it has a very clean smell. I did not like HAPPY AF as much, it was too floral for me. The HYPED AF was okay, I really could smell the mandarin and nectarine in it."
B0BSRD9WNV,Jam,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2023",Doesn‚Äôt last long.,"The longevity of this fragrance is pretty weak. I stop smelling it within an hour of putting it on.

The component is cool, but I don‚Äôt think that this perfume is really worth the 40.00 price point."

Hyped is just a bit too much lemon, its not offensive but just too strong in the one scent profile. Great buy if you wanna try before buy to a larger purchase."

The perfume smells AMAZING (I‚Äôm SO sensitive and picky with scents!) so I was still going to rate it highly since that‚Äôs the most important aspect of course. Took it back out of the pretty box to take photos and it was purple and blue!
Realization dawned on me and I held it in the freezer air for just a moment and watched it turn completely purple‚Ä¶ except for where my warm fingers were touching it. üòÑüòçüíôüíúüíô

B0BSRD9WNV,MDgirl1053,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",Smell is very nice. Awesome touch sensitive bottle,"The smell of this perfume is very subtle, floral, and feminine. Overall it is a pleasing scent and my husband liked it. Very young and fresh feeling. The bottle fits in your hand very well and has a very neat color changing feature where the bottle changes color where you touch it.

I wasn't a fan of the formatting on the box. They way they used a justified paragraph setting made the packaging look cheap. Should have just centered. The way it is now gives it a knock off/off brand feel IMO.

The product itself inside feels very high end, just wish box looked better."
B0BSRD9WNV,Veronica B,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023",LOVE this sampler pack!!,"I love sampler packs like this that let you try different scents out prior to ordering a full size! Especially at this price (5.99 at time of review), you really do get to sample them out. Although they are small, you only need a few sprays. I spray 1 spritz on my wrist and 1 on my neck and it stayed with me for a while! So the small samples will last a little bit!

They all smell amazing!! Chill AF is probably my favorite, but they really all do smell really really good! Definitely going to be ordering a full size bottle of the Chill AF (and the full sized bottles look adorable)!! Super happy with these perfumes!!"
B0BSRD9WNV,Dingle Girl,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2023",Lovely scent,"I am so pleased with Chill AF by Addison Rae.

B0BSRD9WNV,Deemama,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2023",Obsessed!,"This perfume really, really smells so good. I was super surprised at how great it smells. It has a hint of vanilla and a citrusy sweet smell. I really like it a lot. I‚Äôve had so many people both men and women comment on how good it smells on me. I rarely get any compliments on other perfumes that I‚Äôve had on but this one, people have actually asked what I‚Äôm wearing. It‚Äôs a great scent. Even my teenaged daughter loves it and took it from me! I would definitely recommend this perfume to everyone I know!"

They all smell really good and fresh. Chill af is my favorite its a light fresh scent with no extra scents added.

I did notice a light stickiness after use but it wasn't enough to make me not like it, maybe due to an ingredient?
I would buy all of these perfumes in a large size."

B0BSRD9WNV,M.B. Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023","Delightful floral, fruity scent. Smells expensive.","I am *very* picky about fragrances, and this one is delightful.

I'd say the description in terms of various aroma notes, and the overall presentation is bright, fresh, and fun. It doesn't smell cloying, sweet or cheap.

If you told me this was an expensive department store perfume I would absolutely believe you.

Also the bottle that it comes in is a very unique and cool design as well. Easy five stars."

B0B358R6X9,R34P3RX13,"Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2023",Great scent for the price,"A very sporty scent, without being too strong. It has a good smell that lingers, but not too strong for sensitive noses. It is a good after shower cologne (or after gym workout cover-up) that makes you smell clean and fresh. I like this as a quick throw on scent if I have to run out unexpectedly and don't want to use my more expensive colognes, but smells like a million bucks at the same time. It doesn't last for long, maybe a few hours before it fades, but it does hold for a fair amount of time. I recently used it before going to work for a 16 hour tour and it lasted for a good 6 or 7 hours before I noticed the smell wasn't strong so def worth the buy."

B0B358R6X9,JNieporte,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2022",Very Good Cheapie,"For a $5 aftershave, this one is quite nice. It comes in a branded cardboard box, so you can gift it easily. The bottle itself is glass with a plastic screw-on cap. Nice and clean. This is an aftershave splash, so it pours into your hand and doesn't have a pump or sprayer.
I'll tell you the notes listed, then I'll tell you what I smell.
Top notes are listed as fresh citrus, cool mint, and warm cedar. Base notes of sweet fruits, fragrant woods, and tonka.

To me, Dynamic Pulse opens up with a slightly metallic citrus. It smells pretty good. After a minute or two, you get the mint scent added. After about 10 minutes, those top notes are gone and you're left with h a slightly metallic fruity / tonka mix. This scent lasts about 40 minutes on my skin.
You'll notice I've called this aftershave ""metallic"" and that's because it has this Azzaro Chrome-ish tint. It smells really nice on my skin.

As for how it feels, well, it doesn't burn at all. It comes out like any other liquid aftershave, but it seems to thicken like a lotion when rubbing it on. It FEELS like it's thickening; there's no physical thickening. It soothes very well, and my skin is dry to the touch in about 60 seconds after applying.

Overall, this is a banger for five dollars. It's clean enough for a barber, cool enough for a young shaver, and classy enough for a middle-aged fellow."
B0B358R6X9,Jillian Bragg,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2022",Great Deal,"Bought for my husband, he is very picky about scents because a lot of them trigger his asthma. Once he finds a scent that agrees with him and he can also breathe without any issues while wearing it, he tends to stick with it. He has been wearing Dynamic Pulse for approximately 20 years now and I always look for a good deal when he‚Äôs running low. This purchase was a steal! It was basically two bottles for the price of one! I wasn‚Äôt sure what the bottle size was, so I took a picture of it next to my iPhone XR to compare...after some searching, found out it is a 3.4 ounce bottle (and two came in the package) for about $11-which is usually what you would pay for a single bottle. Very pleased with this purchase. Packaging was decent-it came in a box that was a bit too big for the items it contained (only the two bottles of aftershave were in it). Each bottle was individually wrapped in the bubble wrap, though. So it was a win-win for me...he gets to smell good and I get to pop the bubble wrap!

He is 11 so when he uses a product he is very generous with the amount he dispenses. He still has a lot of product left and has been 2 months (he uses it every night.) Defiantly get your value for your buck. This scent is very clean but not over powering, its quite pleasant. I would purchase it again for the amount of money you definitely get a lot of product."

Used it and liked it, then I was able to get some Pure Sport on Amazon again and I went back to it. Now that the sellers are apparently trying to get rich off every Old Spice product sold, I have given up on them.

Buying the multi-pack is definitely the way to go if you want to pay less. The scent is nice and fresh and clean-smelling and very masculine. A winner for sure!"

It is a comfortable and effective aftershave with a pleasant scent. It is amazing to me how many people, strangers included, will say to me that I smell good, even hours after putting it on. It has a clean fresh scent without smelling like a heavy cologne."
B0B358R6X9,Mellissa D. Farmer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2022",Too strong.

It smells like a 19 year old kid you pass at the mall who doesn't know how to use cologne sparingly. If you're looking for a young modern scent this might be a good choice for you. But if you're looking for a classic barbershop aftershave, this isn't it."

I use about a quarter's worth in the palm of my hand every day and it usually lasts me for 3-4 months. Comes in a sleek glass design that looks nice on my bathroom counter too."

Any residue left over on your hands rinses cleanly off as well. The bottle is nice, thick glass and is shaped for getting a good grip. The lid twists off and on with just a few turns...another small advantage. The modest price is a big bonus. An aftershave like this would be good to stock up on as stocking stuffers for Christmas. I've only used half of my bottle and already plan on buying more...so I'm glad to give this excellent aftershave a solid five stars!"

Everything about this is Mid. You're not gonna stink. I just don't think you'll be the guy in the room people notice for all the right reasons.

Projection is weak
Siaj (scent trail) weak
Opening note mediocre
Drydown almost scentless
Longevity (projection) weak
Longevity (skin-scent) mid
Overall smell 6.5/10

This is a safe smell that won't offend people. It attempts to be fresh and daring. The only issue I have is that it is too modest to compete with more elaborate colognes. Feel free to overspray as long as you let the alcohol evaporate first."

When he puts it on he will still smell good the next day! I love burying my face in his chest and neck to get a whiff as often as I can! You won't be disappointed!

I was looking for cologne for my 11 year old son and settled on this one after my sister told me it‚Äôs what she purchased for my teenage nephew. It‚Äôs the perfect blend of fresh, with a hint of masculine. Not at all childish, but not overly manly. Not to say a grown man wouldn‚Äôt be fine to wear this as well. But it‚Äôs perfect as a first cologne for preteen/teen boys. My son loves it!"

Exactamente, por 4 euros puedes llevarte un frasco de colonia de 100ml que te puede durar un mont√≥n de tiempo si te la aplicas en dosis moderadas.

Obviamente esta colonia no compite en la misma ""liga"" de las grandes fragancias (tipo Armani, Carolina Herrera, Boss y c√≠a.), que son m√°s duraderas y persistentes, pero para el precio que tiene te llevas una colonia que tiene un sutil aroma masculino a c√≠tricos-amaderados que no es empalagoso ni excesivamente ""invasivo"" para el que la lleva ni para nadie de los que est√©n a tu alrededor (que es el defecto de muchas colonias caras) y que yo encuentro muy adecuada para utilizar tras la ducha despu√©s de una sesi√≥n de gimnasio.

Yo la compr√© por probar y mi novia -que es muy sensible y cr√≠tica con otras colonias que yo tengo con aromas penetrantes e ""invasivos""- le ha dado su visto bueno, as√≠ que creo que ha sido una buena compra."

It's strong....he will only need one little spray or I could see it becoming too much quickly. Havent given it to him as will be a gift but I know he will like it.

The package size is perfect, and it will last a while. I haven‚Äôt been able to find this in store around me, so I continue to buy online. It ships quickly and is packaged well.

B000VOMZOY,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2017",Great value for the money,"This stuff is fantastic. It smells lovely, and unlike products I have been purchasing at a similar price point, the scent actually remains on me for hours! Furthermore, the smells of previous products from Agustin Reyes have been lackluster, and the effects wear off quickly.

Comparing the ingredients of the two brands/products shows a striking disparity between what Agustin Reyes puts in their stuff vs Adidas. Overall, Adidas' Ice Dive (and I assume their other fragrances) are far superior.

I plan to switch entirely to Adidas brand cologne, and try out different blends as time goes on and my current bottle runs out. As it is a good, strong cologne, I expect it to last a good while."

B000VOMZOY,j35a6,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2019",Great value,"Very fast shipping, received sooner than estimated 'expected' date. Great value!

B000VOMZOY,Tyson,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2009","nothing special, but it's cheap so...","I have colognes for all occasions. Dates, friends, at work, at the club, just out of the shower.. just need something to smell nice. I've been using this Ice Dive as more in the need of the last two.

Instead of a body splash, this cheap cologne smells nice and leaves me feeling clean after the body wash scent has faded from the shower. Many other times I just want to smell nice, be it to combat with body odors of myself or others or whatever reason, and in those cases you don't want to use your $100 bottle of Obsession. For that kind of scenario, I can recommend this Adidas scent. If you're looking for a signature date-scent, don't waste your time on this though. It smells sterotypical and un-unique. Not bad in any way, it's crisp and clean smelling, just not original enough to be that signature smell."
B000VOMZOY,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2019",Ok,Good amount of ounces for the price and it‚Äôs a very good company and namebrand.

We finally exhausted the previous bottle and his birthday is coming up, so I bought a bottle. This isn't ""full strength"", but it still has an awesome smell and lasts a long time (both when being worn and as far as how far the bottle goes).

OBVIOUSLY this is not something you would get for someone over the age of 17, but it DOES smell nice. Kind of spicy, a little sweet, think of AXE except a little nicer and not as violently in-your-face gym class smell.

I first sprayed it on paper and did not enjoy it, but on skin it bloomed into something beautiful. I just received it today, so I'll update my review after I've worn it several times."

The scent was stuck on my couch from when I first tried it on, and for weeks I wanted to take the arm off the thing I hated the scent so bad. The orange blossom and amber was all I smelled and it just wasn‚Äôt giving. But alas yesterday it caught me by surprise, and OMG IT SMELLED SO GOOD!!! A very pretty fruity gourmand. It can be layered with a vanilla or coconut scent to bring it to life. I can‚Äôt stop sniffing at the bottle now lol.

The bottle and packaging is beautiful. This was a blind buy fail for me. I was expecting this beautiful tropical fruity coconut scent but that's not at all what I got from it. I got the fruitiness but it was stale and flat. Sort of reminds me of stale candy. This is not to insult the scent, so many people love it and have raved about it. Unfortunately, it just didn't work out for me. But that's fragrances work, they are so different to each individual. Thankfully it wasn't an expensive blind buy, I would try to sample before buying."

Tbh, I prefer this fragrance because it meshes better with my chemistry, plus it has a hint of powder undertone to it.

B07RTQ4VM7,David,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2023","Before you Buy, Read this","Afnan 9PM is honestly one of the top colognes in my collection. The smell is very sweet and opens quite fresh, juicy, elegant and sugary, but it dries down very warm and ambery with a huge dose of vanilla.
I have smelt the real deal(JPG Ultra Male) and I prefer Afnan 9PM. Many people won‚Äôt say this but Afnan 9PM is SWEETER, and does seem to be stronger too! Jean Paul‚Äôs Ultra Male is more masculine and heavy but the Scent of Afnan 9PM isn‚Äôt super feminine.
Performance is decent, I have got the super duper longevity people talk about, but the projection in the beginning is INSANE.
Is it worth it? It‚Äôd say so yeah. Way better than my Club De Nuit Intense Man(CDNIM) EDT Aventus clone."
B07RTQ4VM7,Amidreaming,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2023",Love it!!! Buy it! Great price!,I‚Äôm a masculine lesbian who loves cologne and this cologne did not disappoint!! Blind bought it after seeing people say good things on Tik Tok and I‚Äôm so happy with it!! It came a day earlier than it said it was going to!!! The smell is very bubble gum powder but masculine and not in an overpowering or bad way. It‚Äôs an easy wear. I don‚Äôt have to worry about it giving me a headache. Also even though it has a candy smell it‚Äôs not too sweet. Buy it unless you don‚Äôt want to smell good and then don‚Äôt!! Lol üòù
B07RTQ4VM7,ahsanisboss,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023",Very solid daily cologne,"I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Afnan 9pm for Men fragrance due to all the hype of TikTok. As a current Tom Ford user, I am a big fan of spicy luxurious scents. I am quite satisfied with the cologne overall. First and foremost, the unboxing experience felt very classy. The sleek, black bottle with its magnetic cap not only looks elegant on my dresser but allows it to fit in with my other more high-end colognes.
Now, let's talk about the fragrance itself. The initial top notes of citrus, bergamot, and blackcurrant are invigorating and refreshing, always earning me compliments.
Now as much as I want to continue saying positive things regarding the cologne, I must say I was a little disappointed by the longevity. For the first few hours, it is definitely noticeable but despite what others say, I feel as though it tapers off HARD rather fast after that. By the afternoon, unless someone is essentially hugging me, they will not smell the Afnan. It is definitely a great casual fragrance, though! The versatility of the cologne is something that I greatly appreciate. While it works wonderfully as a sophisticated evening scent, it is also suitable for daytime wear, adding an air of confidence and elegance to any outfit. Whether I'm at the office, attending a formal event, or spending a casual day out with friends, this fragrance feels appropriate for any occasion.
If you are looking for a good daily cologne or something with an unbeatable bang for buck, I would say buy Afnan 9pm!"
B07RTQ4VM7,Dylan,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2023",Pleasantly surprised! Great blind buy!,"I purchased this through a recommendation that this is a great bang for the buck & that it smells great!

After smelling this I‚Äôm already in love with it! 100% will recommend this as a blind buy to anyone who‚Äôs looking for a great night time/ going out scent at an amazing price."
B07RTQ4VM7,MJ Lnres,"Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2023",Descent everyday option at moderate price.,"Saw the video review on Facebook (as many others probably did), cologne was available at Amazon for about $30 and decided to give it a try. Although not amazed by the sweet scent, I have to say it is my go to cologne to pick when heading to the office or gym. Longevity is moderate, I would buy it again once I run out."
B07RTQ4VM7,J.P.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2023","Great projection, just doesn‚Äôt last compared to others",Nice vanilla scent that‚Äôs not too sweet. Projection is excellent but wished the longevity was better. Overall a great cologne for the price.

A friend of mine suggested I try Afnan 9pm before I bought a full bottle of Ultra Male. Wow. On a blind buy, I did just that. The scent is 90-95% similar to JPG, the performance is crazy, and the longevity is 9+ hours. They replaced the pear accord with green apple. This DNA is pleasant and not overbearing. The price made my choice easier. 9/10. One to add to any collection."

The smell of this is amazing! Smells like Ultra Male, but better and stronger! I‚Äôve had it on for a few hours after receiving it and I can smell myself non stop. Big whafs of vanilla, cardamom, and a sweet apple and lavender. It‚Äôs super sweet, but not overly sweet. It‚Äôs still masculine. I will be buying again. I‚Äôm 3 hours into the fragrance and it‚Äôs such a beautiful scent. So powerful. By far the best I‚Äôve ever bought on Amazon.

Definitely worth the money though when compared against my Jean Paul Gaultier at $90.00."

B07RTQ4VM7,Arber,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2023",Too good Cant wait to buy more!,"Sure, here is a review of Afnan 9pm for Men Eau de Parfum Spray, 3.4 Ounce:

Afnan 9pm is a popular fragrance for men that is often compared to Jean Paul Gaultier Ultra Male. It is a sweet, fruity fragrance with notes of apple, cinnamon, lavender, and bergamot. The heart notes are orange blossom and lily of the valley, and the base notes are vanilla, tonka bean, amber, and patchouli.

Afnan 9pm is a great choice for a night out. It is long-lasting and has a moderate projection. It is also relatively affordable, making it a great value for the price.

Here are some of the pros and cons of Afnan 9pm:

Pros:

Long-lasting
Moderate projection
Affordable
Sweet, fruity scent
Great for night outs
Cons:

Can be too sweet for some people
Not as unique as some other fragrances
Overall, I think Afnan 9pm is a great fragrance. It is well-made, long-lasting, and affordable. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new fragrance."
B07RTQ4VM7,Romy Tapia de la Rosa,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2023",,"Este perfume trae muchos cumplidos, tiene buena longevidad, este queda excelente para salidas especiales."
B07RTQ4VM7,Leo Atreides,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2023","Great buy, very similar to JPG Ultra Male","Pretty spot on to Ultra Male. Opens up slightly more harsher and synthetic and ""sharp"" in its sweetness, but a bit brighter too. It's also apple rather than pear but that doesn't really make a huge difference. The dry down is beautiful and a bit more base notes compared to ultra male, which keeps it's top notes for most of it's duration. The projection is great in it's opening and decent during the rest of it, not as strong as UM. It also does not have the same longevity and turns into a skin note maybe 6 hours in. But it's a great cheap buy IMO."

When you first spray all you will smell is alcohol so let it sit on your skin for about 45sec to a minute. Now once you get past that all I smell after is a hint of lemon with a mix of fresh leaves. I'm trying to paint a picture here for you guys but think of getting green leaves and smashing it up and smelling that and spray some lemon juice on that. This is what that smell is.
I initially believed this was going to smell like Delina but this is definitely not Delina. So if you are going to blind buy for a Delina dupe STOP ‚úãÔ∏è this is not it!!!!!"

A week later I went to wash the shirt and it was as if I just sprayed myself. This scent fragrance is a winner!"

It is extremely long lasting, lasts DAYSSS on clothes and at least a full 24 hrs on the skin. And the fragrance is beautiful!! Extremely floral with hints or citrus and some depth. It‚Äôs a very pretty fragrance, perfect for spring and summer and has become one of my all time favs. Every single time I wear it I‚Äôm asked what it is"

I‚Äôve worn it three days in a row, and my roommates have told me to never spray it in our house again. My coworkers told me I smelled like an old lady. And my parents were flat out offended by the smell. I really have no idea why it has such amazing reviews. It does last forever, unlike most female perfumes. Everyone, literally EVERYONE I encountered told me to never wear this again. I even sprayed it in the air (to make sure it wasn‚Äôt just the way it was reacting with my body chemistry) for my roommates to smell. And they immediately cracked the windows and sprayed Febreze. This smells like somebody sprayed White Diamonds on a sewage plant. It‚Äôs a headache and a bottle. I wanted to like this so bad, but nobody around me liked me with it on."

I was looking for something different instead of something that smells generic."
B08JTBR9MN,SiB,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2022",Not for beginners!,"This perfume is definitely for an acquired taste.

First, the good: Nice presentation; the box and bottle are of high quality, or seem that way. The scent is quite strong, sillage is moderate (people would have to be within arms length of me before they can sense it). Longevity on me is ridiculous; more than 12 hours for sure! The price for the quality is fantastic!

The not so good (maybe): This perfume is definitely not for everyone. At the open, it smells of burning wood (not in a good way). I'm a big fan of incense and frankincense, but this one is quite off putting for me in the beginning. The dry down is much better; it settles into a sweeter incense sort of smell akin to an Oriental incense fragrance. Most others who smelled it on me were not a fan.

Verdict: Have you ever been near an open fire of wood? You know that smokey smell that stays on your clothes afterwards? Did you like that smell? Yes? Then this is for you! No? Stay far away!"

As the name suggest you get a lot of incense and a strange medicinal note in the opening. You get the smoky note, the oud, the amber let‚Äôs this fragrance projects.

B08JTBR9MN,Banko,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2021",Pain then pleasure,"The opening will turn u off just as smelling it from the cap (very green herbal medicine like smell). Best to spray it on clothes and let it air for 5-10 mins. Then it cools down and will be be an ok scent (kind of mature like) but throughout the day it will transform into something magical that u will fall in love with!! If u can stand the opening to spry it on skin it transforms a lot faster and it is lovely!!! It lasts for over 8 hrs on clothes (forever lol). The opening is explosive as it is repulsive and fills up a room but it quiclkly settles (in tht 5-10 mins) n then only people who come within ur reach will smell u. That mid and dry down is worth enduring the opening. The mid is sweet n smoky, the dry down is leather n oud."

It has a strong herbal note and the incense seems very synthetic. I was excited to try this because it‚Äôs supposed to be a clone of interlude but for me it‚Äôs a hard miss.
Maybe I got a bad batch but I will never wear this, I‚Äôll try to find someone who likes it and give it to them as I can‚Äôt return it for whatever reason. It was a waste of money for me, the scent does last a long time though which isn‚Äôt good if you don‚Äôt like it"

This does not smell cheap, their are quality ingredients but I dont think this scent is for the casual person. It smells like incense and a clean fun kind of smell. In my head it makes me imagine it smells like a brand new music studio with dimmed lights with kind of a hippie theme going on and they have insense burning but also drinking juice. It also gives off mad cornerstore vibes but better. for the price if you are frag collector this is worth buying because it is different"

This stuff...I've never smelled the fragrance this is supposedly imitating, but, ew. I knew it was supposed to be an incense heavy fragrance, what I didn't expect was for it to smell just like my old wooden incense burning box, when it's cold and overflowing with the stale ashes of incense past. I have only tried it on paper thus far, so perhaps it undergoes a fantastic change on skin... I will try it out the next time I don't need to leave the house for a while. For my initial impression based on the opening and dry down on paper, I'm not a fan. I hate to say it because they make some really good fragrances, this one may simply not be for me.

B08JTBR9MN,Larry A.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2022",A spicy treat that's perfect for fall and winter,"It is very dense and smoky in the open. That incense jumps out but is alluring. The scent trail retains the sweeter notes but anything close to skin gets a strong incense feeling. The mid is where the spices settle, Leather, Labdunum and Amber emerge to smooth out the edges.

This phase makes this scent shine. The mid's longevity is insane and the drydown is fantastic. It's a mature, mysterious scent that pulls you in. I love this scent. It will likely take a place high in my winter fragrances.

Update: It grows on you. Currently rocking during mid-winter and it's my favorite cold weather scent. It's complexity is soothing and the price is alright with me."

This smell great and is legitimate . I was very shocked actually. And I have other scents from thier line too but this one here is Excellent. Some reviews. May disagree but I'm telling you the truth and I hate writing and I just said to my self let me write this to help out other guys who may have questioned it like me...that's all.

Thanks Afnam but not thanks.
ps: with all due respect I do not believe on such this as bad batch or good batch ,yes any fragance will perform better after 1 or 2 years or maceration but why having to wait that long of a time ?

B000E7YL3G,JVAN,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2009",Stands out,"I recently wanted to expand beyond my old and paltry collection of Drakkar, Georgio RSVP (yes, I lived in the 80's), and Kenneth Cole RSVP. So I bought the sampler of CK from Amazon (Obsession, Eternity, CK One, IN2U, and Euphoria). Euphoria was my favorite, IN2U was OK, and the other two made my eyes water for hours. I then buckled down and got full size bottles of Versace Pour Homme, Cool Water, Alfred Sung, Versace Dreamer, and Very Irresistible.

Dreamer and Very Irresistible smell almost like clones of each other. Versace for Men and Euphoria, are also pretty close, although Versace is much cleaner and more complex. Cool water is nice. That's it. It is nice. Good for business or a night out with your sister. The rest of the CK line is too common. That leaves Sung. This is by far THE most unique scent I purchased. It doesn't smell remotely like any of these others. It has the smell of aged oak that is freshly cut. It's THAT woodsy. And it doesn't smell artificial. Two spritzes on my neck and one inside each elbow and I'm good to go for 4-6 hours. I'm afraid to try it on my clothes in fear that it will get on my coat, and fight with other scents when I decide to wear something else.

If you want a true ""woodsy"" scent in your collection, that has NO sweetness, but isn't a slap in the face either, then pick up this older, affordable scent. Even though it's an older scent, it stands out from others. Way out."
B000E7YL3G,Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2019","Not Quite Irish Spring, but Better!","After doing a little bit of digging, I found out that this blue-ish version of the Alfred Sung for Men 3.4 oz is more of a recent update rather than a knockoff of the older purple-ish version like some reviewers claim.

I bought this as a complete blind buy from Amazon Services and I'm impressed with it. I can definitely see some of the comparisons to Irish Spring body wash but I would say this has a slightly spicier manly soapy scent. It's a very clean versatile scent that can be worn in just about any formal or casual occasion. The sillage is pretty good for an EDT with decent projection without being overbearing and the longevity lasts around 6+ hours before drying to more of hugger on my skin.

All-in-all, I'm very pleased and won't hesitate to pickup another bottle once this one runs out."

B000E7YL3G,Josh T,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2018",Love this cologne,"This is my first time wearing Sung, so I'm not sure if it's been reformulated or not, but the smell is amazing. I tend to not like modern fragrances as much, as they're so sweet and citrus-y smelling, and this cologne is definitely not that. It smells like a man's cologne. It's very strong at first; you really should let it settle in for at least a half hour before you'll be around people, as you might offend them haha. But once it starts to dry down...man, this cologne is good. It has mostly a smell of Irish Spring soap, but slightly more spice. On my skin though, after it's been on for a few hours the spice starts to fade and starts to smell slightly sweet, which is very nice.

To me, it most closely resembles Paco Rabanne, which is another one of my favorite colognes. I think I like Sung more though, as it lasts longer and has a very unique smell all throughout it's lasting time.

Highly recommended."

B000E7YL3G,SLC,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2019",I prefer Sung over Mugler,"There is a big debate over which is a better soapy Irish Spring evocative cologne: Alfred Sung or Thierry Mugler. You know, I never expected to find that I prefer Sung. Sung and Mugler are very similar at their core. However there is just something old ladyish about Mugler. It is unisex after all and a bit sweeter. But what makes the difference for me is the slight smokiness of Sung. Sung is hands down masculine. Theirry Mugler is not -- which explains its rebirth as Come Together. And what a difference in price, especially if you snag Sung in the Warehouse. As to the S-factor in Mugler. Really?!! Who knows what that is. If it's essence of old lady, I don't care for it."
B000E7YL3G,Donald J. Shaw,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2021",The ladies love it,"This is my 3rd bottle, the first from my daughter who told me she loves it on her husband. Each time I wear it, it seems that a lady will make a positive comment. I like the fact that it's not an overpowering smell. Also, I read that cologne lasts longer if kept in the refrigerator which is where I keep this."
B000E7YL3G,Micha,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2022",The seller is misleading.,The fragrance Alfred Sung has the original formula and an updated formula and you can tell the difference in the color of the juice. The original formula is a much lighter violet and the newer formula is a very dark violet. The seller used the item image of the original formula which is deliberately misleading. The darker formula is many times weaker than the original formula. I am EXTREMELY disappointed but do not feel like dealing with the annoyance of returning it. Beware of this seller.
B000E7YL3G,R. Turner,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2023",Not the same scent.

B000E7YL3G,1stHand,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2017",A good buy.,"I like this blend. To me, the smell a pleasant balance between sweet and woody, with just enough strength and staying power to linger a bit without being overpowering. That said, you might want to apply it more than just a few seconds before you join the car pool. The price is good and the Prime delivery great. With a little less sweetness to the blend, I would give it 5 stars. That said, at this price, I will be buying again."

B000E7YL3G,Melvin Nixon,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2018",Overall I'm pleased and the color change is NOT a deal breaker ...,I used to buy Sung by Alfred Sung years ago and it was the light purple color. The product I received thru your company has a deep blue color with a slight difference in scent. I'm ok with that since it could have changed in color due to new smellers or fragrant blenders and several years have passed since I used this product. Overall I'm pleased and the color change is NOT a deal breaker at all.
B000E7YL3G,Nick,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2015",Purple Sung Fragrance for Men,"Bought a $15 small bottle as a blind buy because I had heard this was close to Irish Spring. My first impression was a resounding no, and it was so bad that I almost threw it out. I've found that with this stuff, you have to go very light -- lighter than I've ever gone with any fragrance to be honest. If you apply with the lightest touch, you get a good thing going that I would describe as a blend of pine trees, tobacco, and Irish Spring. It's just okay, though it's gotten some attention. Good for an older gentleman in a tie maybe, but this really isn't my style. I'm 27, very athletic, and a working-class straight guy who prefers smelling more like a down-to-earth guy-next-door than a posh club-goer. I'm definitely into inexpensive stuff but this one's not for me. May consider wearing again in 25 years if it's still around."
B000E7YL3G,CG,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2019",Let's get something straight: Does NOT smell like Irish Spring,"To the people who said this smells like Irish Spring Soap, when's the last time you actually had a bath? This stuff smells like super powerful cheap cologne. I don't smell even a hint of anything resembling that classic Irish Spring Soap scent (I use the stuff every single day).

If you're looking for a scent thats a subtle, just had a shower refreshing scent, but without the obvious ""he's wearing a cologne"" bullseye, this isn't the scent for you.

I give it a 3/5, considering the price range (obviously compared to more expensive stuff this score would go down). If anything changes I will update the review but for now: you get (and smell like) what you pay for - cheap cologne."

I used to even have married women ask me what it was for their husbands. After the years went by I used other scents but recently I sought this one out again and had a hard time finding it. I never thought to look on Amazon and here it was, and cheap too. I used to pay $45 or more for this same bottle in the 90's and here it is only $18! The scent still gets me the same response it did back when I was younger and single. I have had nothing but compliments from this. I was using cologne that cost $70-$80 for an ounce but not anymore!"
B000E7YL3G,Brandon H.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2017",Concentrated soap spray,"As a 22 year old, this is a little too ""old"" smelling for me. I have designated it as my aftershower ""clean and soapy"" smell that I spray once on me. I use this when I want to smell clean and fresh, but for nothing else. It's not a sexy smell, but it is a simple, clean smell. I wouldn't ever use this as one of my pain scents that I want people to notice when I walk into the room. If you intend to use it like me, it might be worth it since it is cheap. Lomani homme lomani is a little bit better option, as it is not as soapy, and has a few more modern notes in it."

Hmmm. I have been using this Cologne/Eau de Toilette since the day it came out, ~30 Years.
Loved that it was ‚ÄúShips and Sold by Amazon‚Äù, especially with Prime
This delivery was ‚Ä¶ off‚Ä¶

Before, I was glad to find the GENUINE Alfred SUNG for Men HOMME available directly from Amazon. This order (I bought two bottles) was ‚Ä¶ OFF ‚Ä¶

The Monolith block fancy integrated nozzle was the SUNG Trademark.
This order has a plastic chrome generic nozzle.

SUNG HOMME had an intense vibrant rich purple color;
This one is ‚ÄúBlue ‚Äòish‚Äù, with a tiny hint of purple.

Maybe the wholesaler who provides Amazon had a problem somewhere in the supply chain?

UNLESS Alfred SUNG personally puts out a press release that claims that after 30 Years, they redesigned their bottle nozzle design and shifted the color of the cologne/Eau d T, I am gonna have to call this one out as HIGHLY Suspect.

B000E7YL3G,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2019",Not what it looks like in the Image. This is a knockoff,"Be aware, this is a knockoff. The black top is just that, a top. It comes off to reveal the sprayer. The color of the cologne is a dark blue, not a purple like in the picture. The smell wears off very quickly when the real cologne would last all day.The picture that is posted is not what you actually get. Dung was known to have a almost unique sprayer/dispenser. There black top was the mister. This one though, the black top is just that, a top. It comes off to reveal the mister which is obviously a fake.. Second time now buying the "" Amazon Choice"" of this product, and now both times been ripped off. Very disappointed"

I used to purchase it from Carson Pierre Scotts, but they discontinued it. Finally, seeing it again, I got excited just to be highly disappointed. Please make it like it was! I'm not trying to put anyone on blast, but rather bring attention to hopefully getting the establishment of the original product. Right now, purchase at your own risk. I do not like it. You have to find ways to mix it or just give or throw it away."

After opening it I realized it wasn't. I read the reviews and thought that it would be a good change. I have tried to wear it twice and have gotten a headache each time. I know I can't return it but hope this will help someone not make the same mistake as I did. Because it is a parfum it lasts forever.

B000C1Z19C,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2017",I was happy with the merchandise I paid for,"I was happy with the merchandise I paid for, the quality of the vendor's service was great. The fragrance itself is what warranted the 4 out of 5 stars. Get Alfred Sung's 'Shi,' it smells better than pure. Pure kind of just smells like you've bathed with nice soap, it doesn't float around you like shi does. You have to be nose to skin to actually smell it and it is just not that great of a fragrance."
B000C1Z19C,DuayneD,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2008","Classy stuff! Your wife, etc, will thank you for it.","As noted by other reviewers, Pure isn't easy to find, especially at such a reasonable price -- and thank goodness for Prime shipping options!
Kudos to Amazon.
I -- and more importantly -- my wife think this is a lovely, nearly unique, but not overpowering fragrance good for wearing anytime.
I first bought it for my wife 5 or 6 years ago -- for some reason, I thought back then it was spelled Pur (no e) -- and was pleasantly surprised how much she liked it. (Everyone knows what a gamble it is for us men to buy fragrances that our women have not pre-approved!)
But if you/she haven't smelled it, I'd suggest trying to find it at your local department store and ask them for a whiff. No description you'll find in these ratings can substitute for your/her nose."
B000C1Z19C,Borah J,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2021",Nice!,"This is a nice fragrance for casual and being around the house. It is light yet present enough to know you're wearing a nice quality perfume. It is also long-lasting, so you don't need to use a lot of it or reapply."

It got difficult to find so I switched to something else. But I am ecstatic that Amazon has it! When I wore Pure, I got many compliments & was often asked what it was. I fell in love with the scent when I found an advertising swatch inside a magazine. I don't like anything heavy & musky, but I also don't want to smell like a rose garden. This is a great fragrance regardless of your age. Try it! (Also if you get a gift set that has the soap in it, put it the drawer with your ""delicates"". It makes them smell wonderful.)"

I was a bit skeptical because I'd never smelled it myself before....but she loves this! I love it because it is not too ""in the face""... I may buy a bottle for myself. She is 50 and I am 20 so I love that it works for a wide age range. It's very subtle and floral. Not sure how to compare this scent it's very unique."

It's light, and suitable for anytime wear, and has decent longevity. I find it a little bit on the boring side, but its good for those times when one of my more 'interesting' fragrances would be too much. Recommend to anyone who likes light floral scents."

B000C1Z19C,anderlinck1,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2016",Definitely good enough,"Obviously this isn't authentic- this perfume went out of production years ago...but it's pretty darn close. The bottle is cheaper than the real perfume- the cap is obviously not the cap of an $80 bottle of perfume. That being said, it WASNT an $80 bottle of perfume. Still smells good, and if you didn't know better, you'd think it was actually Alfred sung. Definitely worth what I paid."

B00HV9FWM4,Semina,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2023",This use to be one of my favorites to wear,"In the past I've bought this perfume because it smelled lovely. If you haven't bought this perfume before, there are 3 versions of it. The original which is a mild floral scent with just a slight gold color. The 2nd is a lightweight scent of the floral and is clear in color. The 3rd is a citrus scent, it's clear with just a slight touch of pink. In the past this perfume used to have the labels on the actual bottles to let you know the scent and the concentration level. My guess is for aesthetics and marketing they remove the labels on the bottles. The boxes all look the same with the ingredients listed on the back. They don't tell you the concentration level or the scent you're buying. You are taking a risk if you buy it online. This is a theory that I have. I believe SHI perfume is going to be discontinued. In the past three years, this perfume seems to be watered down. This perfume is classified as a Eau De Parfum or EDP which 15-25% is oil based. If you're lucky the fragrance should last 3 hours. My last few purchases the fragrance lasted 1 and half hr. Once again this is my opinion I believe That the manufacturer is using less oil-based ingredients which now classifies it as a Eau De Toilette(EDT) or Eau Fraiche (EF). Which basically has less than10% perfume oil and is mostly water. It won't even last 45 minutes. If you want to buy a fragrance that is mostly perfume oil itself whether it's plant, tree or mineral, look for a fragrance on the label that says: PARFUM as the first ingredient. It is usually 30 to 40% perfume oil, and these are the ones that can be a little expensive also remember that name brand doesn't mean quality."

I‚Äôm in my mid 20‚Äôs and it does not have a grandma smell at all. (That was my fear) I feel like it has a mature musk to it but it is totally a winter or fall perfume. It doesn‚Äôt have enough floral for a summer scent.

On the other hand‚Ä¶ Satin Oak is not what I expected. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it smells good just a lot stronger than I thought it would be for a knock off. The Oak defiantly stands out in this one whitch makes it a winter smell hands down. I would say it‚Äôs a more feminine oak smell. I found out that throughout the day it smells better.

Both perfumes lasted me all day without having to reapply it. It doesn‚Äôt smell like alcohol or baby powder like some reviews I read. Packaging way 100% amazing! Mine came in a cardboard box with packaging peanuts and secured within another packaging bag!

B0B6Q6JL7M,Kingskid,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2023",Don't Need MFK,"I wanted something with the same DNA as MFK Satin Mood. I tested them both on skin at the same time and the difference was so minimal. MFK was smoothly sharper in the opening, but within about 10 minutes I could not tell the difference. I'm serious... On my skin it was that close. In performance, it lasts longer than MFK, projecting well for the first few hours and continues to remind you it's there even up to about 7 hours. I consider it to be a ""gentle beast mode"" fragrance that is quite classy, but may be best suited for those who already have a good collection of fragrances. It stands in a league of its own and experiencing others first will cause you to appreciate this unique blend far more. The MFK brand was not love at first sniff, but when I came back to it further in my journey, I knew it was far more special than I had realized. Baroque Satin Oud ensures I can have the same quality experience for a mere fraction of the cost of the former while not forsaking an artful blend~"
B0B6Q6JL7M,RJ,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2023",Nice unisex fragrance,"This is apparently supposed to be a dupe for MFK Satin Oud. I have not smelled the original. But when I smell this I do get hints (distantly) of burnt sugar and gourmand as in the MFK Baccarat Rouge 540 scent profile. There is certainly a relation there. The rose really jumps out most to me. The vanilla is subtle. The oud is least noticeable. The initial spray was a bit synthetic on me. It is a VERY powdery fragrance. Not a stereotypically middle eastern scent, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for. I saw a few people say this smells like expensive dove soap and they couldn‚Äôt be more spot on. Overall, this is a pretty nice fragrance. It smells very niche, mature and sophisticated. I see me pulling this one out for special occasions or dates.

I can‚Äôt address dry down, compliments or performance yet because I just sprayed for the first time.

I have mixed emotions about the scent. It is very hard to describe. This is a beautiful complex sent that is slightly sweet and has a light hint of musk and smells expensive and luxurious. I haven‚Äôt decided if this is something that I will continue to wear because it is on the sweeter side and I‚Äôm not really a sweet perfume fan. It‚Äôs definitely for an acquired taste."
B09F3312YR,MTS,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2023","Deep dark osmanthus scent for about 5 minutes.... Then, it's gone!","At first spray, this is a very powerful osmanthus smell. It's not a super fresh note. It's more of a deeper, almost masculine ""fragrance oil"" osmanthus scent. I don't hate it. But, it's not the fresh, light, bright, apricot-y osmanthus that I was hoping for it to be.

At about 5 minutes in, it turns into a sort of generic floral scent... It's pleasant. But, it's nearly impossible to notice anything other than something totally generic white floral close to your skin. Then... about 10 min in, you have to bury your nose against your skin to smell anything at all... Then, 10-15 minutes later it's just... GONE! There is ZERO longevity. (And, this was using two very generous full sprays right onto my skin. I tested this twice. First, with one spray...then, 1 hour later two full sprays on the same spot. Under one hour later.... the scent just vanishes! If I were to do this with the real thing, I'd have to take a shower to wash the scent off it would be so over-powering and strong.)

So, is this a dupe? No. It's a VERY one note osmanthus perfume. And, it's a short lived one at that."

Initially, I sprayed the fragrance and was disappointed because I got a whiff of GGGB mixed with the scent of thee terrible infamous White Diamonds. (booooo), but, as the fragrance settled I smelled the GGGB. Now I will say that the fragrance doesn't have the same ""heaviness"" as the actual GGGB but for the cost, it gets close enough to make my bank account and I happy. Also, the item was delivered insanely fast....I just ordered it Tuesday night (almost a day a go) and here it is Thursday afternoon and it already arrived. The package was secure and delivered way before the initial ETA. I definitely think that this fragrance is worth the buy.

P.S.-as I sniffed my arms again, I detected something in there that Kayali has in all of its fragrances.... while I have over a 100 bottles of perfume and have been obsessed with fragrance since I was 7 years old and I'm 42 now, I don't know all of the ""fragrancier vocab"", so, I'll say that this fragrance is light, powdery and faintly sweet smelling. Definitely let the fragrance dry down or else you will think that you've been catfished with white diamonds....lol. I'll update tomorrow to let you all know if I could still smell the fragrance from the hamper or not."

B09F3312YR,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2023",Packaging and Odor Bad,"The product arrived wrapped in plastic, but I could see dirty fingerprints on the box and some dirt, so I know it was repackaged in plastic a 2nd time by someone who had already opened it. Additionally, the smell of the packaging and the bottle therein was bad, I don't think it was stored in a clean temperature controlled place, because the item smelled like the back of a dusty old liquor store, that had sour spirits spilled. Upon spraying the actual perfume, it was not a white floral/apricot scent as its supposed to. It was a pretty faint smell that was also a bit sour. I do wonder if I have a bottle that may have gone bad, but this is absolutely awful. I have hundreds of fragrances and I just know something is wrong here. I had to put the perfume back in its box in the back of a storage drawer to get the odor out of the room. Buyer beware."

The scent is spectacular and smells effen expensive. The only thing is that the longevity isn't there for me so I have to use at least 5 sprays which is powerful at first but then has a major 'dry down'. No matter, it's still worth buying. This would be an 'ALL SEASON' scent for myself as I can't say it's just a Summer or Winter fragrance. Very versatile in that respect which I love. This is something that could also be 'layered' with another scent that has a strong musk or a deeper complexity. Bottle looks beautiful in amongst my collection."

B0B83517WC,Brittany,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023",Quality floral but definitely leans feminine.,"As the title suggests, this is a quality floral but in my opinion leans very much feminine. I would not recommend this to men or women looking for a masculine leaning or equally unisex scent. Still five stars because it smells great IF you like floral fragrances, specifically if you like rose being the star of the show.

I think this is suited for those aged 25 years and up and best worn in spring and summer due to its scent profile obviously. It is strong and lasting enough to wear fall and winter. It‚Äôs very strong actually lol which is always a plus in my book.

Great scent and modern but too much on the feminine side for the purpose of my purchase. Gave it away to a couple of family members and they love it so I didn‚Äôt lose anything."

That being said, roses it is not. It's a warm vanilla-y musk with a brief after-smell of rose. So if you want to buy this wanting to smell like a literal rose, this is not for you. It doesn't have any floral notes to it, just that deepness a rose has.

If you want to smell like literal roses and don't want to pay a whole lot, Pacifica Persian Rose is amazing for that. The packaging isn't nearly as pretty and you don't get nearly as much product but the smell is undeniable."

Upon reading positive reviews stating it matched some high end brand‚Äôs scent, which I am unfamiliar with, I bought 3 scents! Absolutely not a good idea. I love woody, rose, leather scents so I was hoping to buy these and use them daily. What a waste! They do not smell consistent each time. The first burst might smell good‚ÄîI was almost too excited that they might be great‚Äîbut then they just leave a nasty cheap smell. Some even smell like armpit! I can‚Äôt even return them. So disappointed. Not worth it. Packaging and bottle are cute, but that is the only upside. Totally useless unless you are buying it as a decoration."

However, the fragrance is fully lacking any rose scent at all. The only thing I smell is a very earthy patchouli scent. Nothing rose at all. If this were being sold as something different it would be fine, but calling it Rose Petals with zero rose fragrance is misleading. It‚Äôs a strong scent and it lasts. The fragrance it is is nice and I like it, just not what I expected or thought I was buying at all. Disappointing."

B07TCFHYPL,Denise,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2023",NOT A BLIND BUY!,bottle came in a luxurious packaging its heavy and looks expensive. this leans very warm feminine and I like to layer vanilla perfumes over it like I wantchoo by jimmy choo. I didn't like it as much as I thought I would because I'm not used to oud perfumes but it grows on you. At first I didn't think it lasted long at all but family tells me it lasts after work 10 plus hours. However not everyone will like it my boss would ask what that hospital smell is when I wear a lot of it because I couldn't smell it on me anymore so a little goes a long way. A couple people have gave me compliments but not more than when I where any other perfume. Overall I don't think I would repurchase but it isn't bad just strong to some people.

I have worn this scent on several occasions, like day time winter and night time winter occasions. I can honestly say that this fragrance is great for day or night use, specially in the winter time or cold days/nights. I like to use this with my chocomusk or creamy/ vanilla scents. This is a unisex, can either go both ways to be honest. It does have a Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille vibe to it. To elevate it and make it more feminine, layer it with vanilla/ creamy/ chocolate scents.

It's odd that not many people mention the box! The box alone is a beautifully made container with a metal plate engraved with the cologne's name. Upon first spraying; It smells amazing. Same DNA as the original AH Amber Oud but smokier, thicker, and sweeter. The initial scent of vanilla gives way to cloves, cinnamon and anise. The dry down reveals smoky incense and sweet amber with subtle woodsy notes. It's a very thick frag that doesn't need too many sprays. I sprayed twice on either side of my neck on my pulse points and one on my chest under my tee shirt.
The silage is a beast and I smell it lingering while walking around my house. At the time of writing this review it's 6 PM EST. I sprayed it at 4 PM and it's as strong now as it was on the initial spray. Great longevity!
I would like to sincerely apologize to the sellers for complaining about the delay in shipping. This frag was well worth the price and the wait, and I will definitely be purchasing it again in the future!"

I own both perfumes and love them! This scent is best for fall/winter because I live in Arizona desert with high heat but I tested it last summer in 125 degree heat and loved it. Long lasting in heat it should last all day at least 8 hours but if below 90 degrees it lasts 12 hours on my skin even after showering! It projects at least 6 feet with lingering trail for first couple hours and you will smell it on yourself all day. Worth it to buy!

Well its not even close, and I know IFi knows his scents so I suspect that there has been a change in formulation, or use of lesser quality ingredients. This, unfortunately, happens with Clone Providers, and it is irritating as all get out. Of course with a liquid there is no AMAZON return policy, and I have had no luck contacting the provider, so it sits in a corner as a $65 paper weight. NOT HAPPY."

I specifically sprayed it one day to test this. I sprayed the perfume on my wrist at 6:13 am, and the smell was gone by 7:06 am. I can‚Äôt smell it on my clothes even right after I spray it either. It also smells like alcohol run when you first spray it, but it quickly fades away. Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt buy this again.

*Edit: I sprayed it on one of my pullovers and the longevity was still pretty short. I couldn‚Äôt smell it at all that entire day, but when I was about to wear it again, a couple of days later, I could smell it just fine. So, maybe spray this perfume on whatever you want to wear in advance."

B084QHZYSZ,Red Lotus,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2021",Best Clone for BR450 Extrait,"I've smelled BR450EDP and BR450Extrait and bought the travel size kits in the past but I decided to go for this in an effort to save and I'm impressed it smells 90-95% like BR450Extrait (The initial note is only a little too strong but after 6 minutes of it developing on the skin it just becomes identical to BR450 Extrait) For longevity it lasts for a good 8 hours on my skin and on clothes it will last for a few days, with all that said the batch I got was good as of now Oct 2021 and I hope Al Haramain doesn't reformulate or have issues with future batches.

As of now this is worth it, my friends know I wear BR450 and they could not tell the difference.

B084QHZYSZ,Jenny Loepp,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2021","Amazing smell, but no longevity","I purchased this perfume while looking for a dupe for BR 540, One of the most intoxicating and addicting smells I have ever smelled. So for anyone else going to purchase I feel like some of these things weren‚Äôt mentioned that I noticed. One of the main differences is that when you first spray this perfume you will get an alcohol smell which you do not get with BR 540, it‚Äôs not an overpowering alcohol smell but you can definitely smell it. The smell is great though I will say that. Both perfumes are spicy when you spray them, I would say that this perfume has a sharper, spicier smell in the beginning where as the spiciness in the BR 540 is more smooth and full-bodied. Unfortunately, the longevity on me just wasn‚Äôt there at all. I sprayed about three or four sprays on my wrist and when I smelled later that night, 4-5 hours later, I could smell nothing at all. But hey, for the price it is worth it!"
B084QHZYSZ,Mr. W,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2022",Baccarat Rouge 540 clone. And a good one.,It‚Äôs really really close to Baccarat Rouge 540. But not at the same time. I love BR540. I got this for my wife cause she loves BR540 too. But I noticed this has a mild almost rubbery scent to it and that makes it different. That smell is also what makes me get sick of this fragrance after about 5 minutes of wearing it. Which sucks cause I love the smell. Silage is good. Longevity is good. And the price is fantastic. A great alternative to BR540. Makes you smell wealthy.
B084QHZYSZ,YF,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2022",This is THE ONE,"I own over 5 BR540 clones but let me tell you, this takes it home.

B084QHZYSZ,jek4,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2021",Great BR540 Extrait clone,"If you're looking for a good, cheap alternative to Baccarat Rouge 540 Extrait, then this one is VERY close. I say this as someone who is very picky/judgmental when it comes to clones/dupes. I don't consider anything a true clone unless it's at least 90% close. I'd put this around 95%.

Now, the longevity and projection on this fragrance were subpar for me. I don't have any experience with this brand, so maybe the quality control is inconsistent. I'm willing to spend more money on some niche fragrances, but I just couldn't justify paying the BR540 prices. Considering the price of this bottle, I'd say it's worth it taking a chance on this one."

I read and watched many reviews that said this fragrance would be largely undistinguishable from BR540. For this particular bottle, I cannot agree.

It smells like alcohol at the opening. It transitions after about 10 minutes. It moves in the direction of BR540, but has an annoying note that reminds me of burning rubber. BR540 has a much fresher opening and is sweeter and more resinous than Amber Oud Rouge.
The alcoholic opening isn‚Äôt pleasant either. I feel like it may be a quality issue, as I have other Al Haramain fragrances which are powerful and great. Perhaps I need a fresher bottle."

B084QHZYSZ,Florida Mc,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2022","Absolutely no scent on fabric, paper, me or my husband. Do not blind buy it!","I have many perfumes and have never had an issue like this. There is no scent at all. I tried it on my skin, paper, fabric, my husband. I have now sprayed about 10% of the bottle in an attempt to see if anything has changed in the week that I have owned it, but still no fragrance. The box is lovely, the bottle itself is elegant, substantial and probably one of the nicest I own, but $60+ is a lot to spend for a bottle and a box despite the elegance. I wrote an email to the company asking what happened and if they could send me a sample so I could see if my bottle is ""off"", but I have heard nothing from them (no surprise). Had read so many reviews about how lovely the scent is and decided to blind buy it, not because it resembles a famous perfume, but because it sounded so nice. I wonder if they have a quality control issue and maybe my batch was water?? I definitely wouldn't recommend buying this unless you are in a store where you can smell the contents.....or unless you are able to return it (which Amazon doesn't allow on this product)."

First- the scent is lovely, not a close clone upon sniffing in air but on my skin it smells really alike. I don‚Äôt have an expert nose and smelling these blindly I‚Äôll probably say this is the BR 540.

Longevity- only wore it for one day and the staying power and sillage is pretty good. About 6 hours.

The packaging- as you can see from my photos, the item is obviously used or damaged. It‚Äôs not full as well, when I sprayed it for the first time (if it was brand new it will take couple of tries for it to spray) this one came right out. The beautiful gold is tarnished, the gold around the spritzer is coming off. I‚Äôm sad that it was a let down. I should‚Äôve checked the return or replacement policy because I can‚Äôt even exchange this for a better one. Lesson learned."

The dry down is less fruity, and the smokiness of the former is much more pronounced.

I'd say if you have both they're nearly identical.

However, the scent is definitely a bargain considering the price point."
B084T5B35G,Bushman,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2023",Smells just like Creed,"It does smell just like Creed. I had a bottle before. Not sure if lack of longevity is due to our noses getting used to the scent or not. My Creed bottle (stolen at a hotel by hotel staff) also seemed to not be apparent after an hour or two. This one also. I'm not sure if it's because our noses get used to the scent of it it is legit fading that fast. I tried spraying some on a shirt hanging in my closet over night. One spray and I could still smell the spot strongly if I put my nose up to the spot. But it certainly didn't project. So I think for some people the nose just get's used to the scent. Either way, for the price, you can't complain, even if you have to apply 2-3 times a day, it's a much better deal than Creed. I bought two bottles, was going to buy more but then learned colognes do expire. Hopefully they keep making this.

That said, I'm surprised Dior Savauge which I also have get's far more complements on YouTube videos than Creed. I think some of those are biased because they don't allow for the dry down. But in every video from a variety of channels, Creed loses to Dior by 4:1"

It didn't capture the authentic essence of amber oud that I'm accustomed to. I've been using a different brand's amber fragrance for a long time, which I usually bring from Qatar, and the quality comparison is not even close.

However I kind of like it because I think it‚Äôs a perfect base for layering because it‚Äôs so heavy any oily. I personally don‚Äôt find it very sweet on me so as a gourmand lover I tend to layer it with a sweeter vanilla fragrance.

I have a sample of Dama Bianca so I compared the two on diff arms and it‚Äôs quite different. It‚Äôs far stronger than Dama Bianca (bigger sillage & longevity) and a few notes are really enhanced (not the white florals or really the vanilla, so I guess malt & kumquat?). I don‚Äôt even like it to be honest :( I feel like a fool bc I had to buy a bottle of Dama Bianca & could‚Äôve saved myself the $50 I spent on this poor imitation.

B07DRQ8192,Robin,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2022",Perfect dupe for Dama Bianca,"Wow! So first of all, this is exactly the same scent as Xerjoff‚Äôs Dama Bianca. I even compared them side by side and asked each of my family members if they could tell a difference‚Ä¶ nobody could tell. The Xerjoff one has been on my wishlist for a while, but it‚Äôs so expensive that I never buy it. Junoon Noir absolutely satisfies that desire for the scent, but I have to say‚Ä¶ this one perform better! It has better longevity and projects a bit more. I wouldn‚Äôt say this is overly loud, but it projects enough that people WILL notice you and ask what the beautiful scent that you are wearing is. It‚Äôs gorgeous! 100% recommend, especially if you don‚Äôt want to pay $300 for the Xerjoff!"
B07DRQ8192,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2023",Smells good but lacks longevity,"This perfume smells good but does not project

I would say the longevity of this perfume gave me over 6 hours on my clothes, to the point my daughter was asking why could she still smell my scent from that morning lol"
B07DRQ8192,Kelz R,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2023",Simply Beautiful!!!!!!!! And BOSS packaging as well!," Strikingly beautiful! That‚Äôs is. That‚Äôs the review. lol. Wait, one more thing: all of the hype is true. It smells exactly like Dama Bianca by Xerjoff. I have both in my collection and I can vouch for the exactness. Also, just my opinion, but this reminds me also of Taylor by Taylor Swift but this one leans a little more boozy. Sweet and lingering and lovely. Those are my descriptions of Junoon Noir. Well done!"
B07DRQ8192,luna,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2023",Smell of the perfume,While the packaging was gorgeous the smell didn‚Äôt fit me.

Comprar a ciegas definitivamente tiene un alto riesgo de decepci√≥n debido a las grandes expectativas que generan los comentarios de algunos ""perfumistas"" de youtube.

Si te gusta oler a ""verde"" un poco apolvado entonces este es el tuyo. En mi caso me inclino m√°s por dos clases de aromas: Dulce, rico y fresco como el Eros de Versace y de notas especiadas como One Million de Paco Rabanne; ambos con buena proyecci√≥n y buen desempe√±o en la fijaci√≥n del olor.

MI EXPERIENCIA (5 atomizaciones al aplicar):
1. Proyecci√≥n muy moderada pasado los 30 minutos.
2. Longetividad en piel y ropa aproximadamente 5 horas; pasado ese tiempo lo seguir√°s percibiendo si te acercas la nar√≠z a la mu√±eca ( suponiendo que te hayas aplicado en esa zona)

The longevity seems to be average or a bit better. It could allways last 12 or 14 hours, but that is probably unreasonable for the composition. The top notes smell very good and do not leave anything at all to be desired. The base notes smell like a MUCH higher quality Cool Water base, but I dont think they are as deep as GIT. All in all, it's a 100% winner if you want a much higher quality Cool Water vibe, and is definitely a contender for similar to GIT."

B07CMZLNZQ,Andrew Belet,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2019",The best Green Irish Tweed clone!,"Short and sweet:
Does it smell EXACTLY like Green Irish Tweed? No. Much more sweet and creamy. But of all the clones of GIT I've tried, and I've tried a LOT, this gets it the closest. Verbena Fields and Emerald Isle from Parfums Vintage have better performance, but also aren't as close to actual GIT as this.

Bottom line...if you like GIT, save up for the real deal. It's one of, if not the, most affordable Creed fragrance out there. However, if you just want to give off the impression of GIT and don't mind re-spraying every four or five hours, this far more affordable option is for you!"

B07CMZLNZQ,Steven P.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2022",Great clone,"First off...I own GIT. Don't listen to the naysayers saying that this doesn't smell anything like Green Irish Tweed. That is false. This is a solid clone that smells probably 95% similar. The biggest difference is in the opening, but after 15min you can't tell them apart in the air. If anything, GIT is a bit smoother. This is definitely worth picking up for the price in my opinion."
B07CMZLNZQ,Stephen Turman,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2019",Great Clone of Creed's Green Irish Tweed,"L'Adventure Knight (LAK) is a great clone of Creed's Green Irish Tweed. I have had a bunch of GIT decants over the years and bought a half used bottle of GIT on ebay last year. To save some money, I have tried a few GIT clones, including Armaf's Tres Nuit and I wasn't really impressed. Tres Nuit is an ok clone, but it's just not constructed very well and it has a synthetic smell to me that I don't get from the genuine GIT. LAK takes this to another level. LAK is a good quality juice for the money. It really nails GIT down and doesn't have a synthetic smell to it like Tres Nuit. The opening is 99% GIT and it remains very close during the dry down. I do get a fruit almost Aventus like vibe once it gets down to the base notes after a few hours, which I don't get from GIT--but who can complain about get a little aventus vibe at the end of this frag's journey. In terms of performance, then genuine GIT has never been a strong performer for me. I get 2 hours of moderate to strong projection (maybe 3 feet if I am heavy on the trigger) for the first 2 hours. After that, the scent bubble shrink down and it becomes a skin sent for another 4 hours (I can get 6-8 longer if it's warm out). LAK gives me about the same level of performance. You're not going to get beastly performance from GIT, so don't expect it from a $35 GIT clone. For the money, you really can't complain. This is a great fragrance for the money and a 95% clone of the original."
B07CMZLNZQ,Chase86,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020",This is beyond a clone,"Hey everyone. Chase86 here. I'm also Chase86 from the most popular fragrance website. You can read other information I gave in the past there, but today, I want to do everyone a favor with this fragrance. I realize that for many they just buy and go and that not everyone is super into fragrances.

First off, if all you're after is a fragrance that smells like Green Irish Tweed, then this is going to be the highest quality version of that you can find with slightly darker DNA compared to Green Irish Tweed. It's fresher actually than Green Irish Tweed and less sweet. It's more green and minty because it has tea leaf. It has all of the notes Green Irish Tweed has, but has less amounts of ambergris and more amounts of tea leaf and powder. It comes across a bit more modern. It dries down to a fresh green smell that is quite addictive. This is basically the best bang for your buck for any fragrance you can buy today. It has fantastic longevity, it smells amazing, and it's extremely affordable. This is the best fragrance basically for the $ that I've ever purchased. The quality is on par with Green Irish Tweed and most people that smell it believe it's better than Green Irish Tweed.

So, some say that this lasts less time than Green Irish Tweed or is synthetic. This is not true. The quality is essentially the same to my nose as Green Irish Tweed. It's negligible. As far as longevity, this one lasts a bit longer. It's fantastic in every regard. It's wild that this is under $35 on Amazon. Anyway, this lasts about 8-10 hours off clothes. After about 6 hours it winds down quite a bit and can only be detected close range. This is only slightly weaker than Dior Sauvage in projection and longevity. It's very close. Three to four sprays is generally enough for me to pop this one into other's noses. It's nice.

This smells extremely fresh and slightly sweet in a green way. It doesn't smell blue like Versace Dylan Blue or Bleu de Chanel. It's a green fragrance through and through. Cool Water is a waste of money at this point since this exists. It's only slightly cheaper and it smells like a deodorizer in it's current formulation compared to this. And yes, I own all fragrances I've mentioned here in full bottles mind you. Besides Parfums de Marly Herod, I don't think there's a fragrance better than this one, and Herod is 8x the price of this one if you buy from Amazon and still 3.5x more expensive if you buy from a discounter. Regardless, you can essentially wear this fragrance all year since it can cut through the cold due to its power. It's strong. It's much stronger than most fragrances out there and it somehow still maintains a natural and non-headache inducing aroma. Nice. Green Irish Tweed is essentially irrelevant to me and I still have about 3/4ths my bottle. I stopped wearing it mostly when I got this since it's better and I can easily buy as much of this as I want without breaking the bank.

To imagine the smell of this, think of the best green smelling soap while you're in the shower and then imagine that smell sticking with you as a fragrance on your body. That's basically this. This is luxury green freshness for a steal.

My girlfriend actually texted me just now stating she wants to wear this when she comes over here in about an hour. As soon as I let her smell this recently, she said it was her favorite fragrance. She said the only fragrances close are Herod and Acqua di Gio Absolu Instinct. I can essentially agree with her on that. She said it's better than Percival, Layton, Foconero, Montblanc Explorer, Dior Sauvage, Dylan Blue, Acqua di Gio Profumo, and Green Irish Tweed itself. I let her smell a bunch of things I have and she chose this one as her favorite. The thing is, it's just so affordable. It may not be an original creation, but that doesn't mean it's not a great creation. It is. And, if you truly spray it and think it's so terrible, then spray it on someone you know and smell it radiating from them. You will be amazed then. It's that good.

Even if you aren't looking for a clone of Green Irish Tweed, I still recommend you buy this one as it will go with most body chemistries. Again, it's affordable, smells amazing, and lasts a long time. It's all season too because it's darker than Green Irish Tweed. Thankfully too as I find Green Irish Tweed a bit too sweet for me, so I like the darkness this brings and enjoy the tone it sets. This is an easy signature scent if you want it to be. You can keep on buying it too without thinking about ""oh I can only wear this for special occasions"" ect.

Give it a try if you'd like! You may just love this one. I know I do, and will continue to. I believe I have 3-4 bottles of this one. Nice stuff!"
B07CMZLNZQ,Gregory W.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2022",Cologne,"I see a lot of people complaining about the longevity of the fragrance. That is because it is a COLOGNE. Now ""Perfume"" contains more aroma oils, which ranges from 15 to 30 percent of the solution, while ""Colognes""

When I spray this, I think of the fragrant equivalent of an energy drink for your nose. The smell is not passive, not submissive, and anything but weak. It is quite strong and a great DNA to get your nose on. If you have a few fragrances, and are into smelling manly, grab a bottle of this, or CLUB DE NUIT INTENSE MAN by armaf. I have both of them, and I would say go with CDNIM if you want more power and challenge to your smell, and go with L'aventure if you want a closer representation of the overpriced scam that is Creed Aventus."

Now the original 1 I have on the black box says AL HARAMAIN (NO 1970) which I thought this was the same bc I already ordered This 1 this wk from amazon and it was BSLLC THIS ONE WAS I FORGET WHICH BUT SAYS AMAZON PRIME so I figured I could return if BS like the other this wk from amazon!! Apparently you can‚Äôt return fragrances bc flames yet they send them!! So do they say can return DO NOT BUY EITHER OR I THINK ANY COLOGNE-PERFUMES FROM AMAZON!! About yr ago I bought 1 of regulars I have sent to me through the Walmart 1 which 2day delivery on everything beyond great/same as amazon...but with this kinda stuff atleast it‚Äôs ALWAYS legit.. I remember when I got that brand name cologne the box was the older version and the bottle was shiny instead of flat colored... also wasn‚Äôt legit so why I think DONT ORDER ANY ESPECIALLY THIS 1 or OTHER FROM BSLLC!! This 1 I thought didn‚Äôt have the 1970 on top just the name bc said not the newer version.. whatever version it is I wouldn‚Äôt spray it in the air to make a room smell good/ I sprayed myself and my eyes teared forever especially the left then it smelled awful I thought the 1 from the other day from amazon same kind was bad this one omg smells like idk alcohol peroxide and lemons etc just ugh!! I can‚Äôt figure it out and absolutely don‚Äôt wanna smell it again!! THis is the only not legit cologne I actually bought b4&liked all my others from savage Dior to Azzaro‚Äôs to JPG all 100% the normal 1s from Walmart online(very few from on Amazon)but this actually like not as an alternate to my creed but to another cologne wear sometimes-well not with either stuck with from amazon&i shop a lot so should know legit if returned!! But learned a lesson u never buy certain things from amazon stick to my specific lists‚Ä¶ and never cologne!! Especially this 1- NEVER LIST!! I even tried again to order yet failed (both same comp at different names)but amazon shouldn‚Äôt even be selling either of them both BS not anything like the original I could call Al HARAMAIN right now tell him Amazon‚Äôs selling knock off of your make of creed bc their that bad I‚Äôve never!! I buy all colognes love them range in price creed to only the brave diesel to Azzaro to YsL etc!! DO NOT BUY THIS ITS HORRIBLE WHAT DOING TO PEOPLE AND I READ THE THE COMMENTS SO I ACTUALLY BELIEVED CERTAIN ONES THEN I REALIZED ITS PROBABLY THEM WRITING THEIR OWN COMMENTS OTHERWISE I GUESS IF U LIKE WEARING BASICALLY lemon WINDEX GO FOR IT!! Horrible do not buy as soon as I opened and say 1970 on the top of biz under the name I knew but I didn‚Äôt think could be worse then the other amazon and omg it could be!! If you see when out n stores and on the black box only on it on th top says AL HARAMAIN TRY IT& probably love it but do not order it bc sending all those and it‚Äôs so bad I still have headache hrs later from it literally!! BUT DO NOT BUY ITS A SCAM üíØ % -if u wanna waste money go for bc all bad legit!!

JUST DO NOT BUY U WANT IT CAN HAVE MINE HORRIBLE AND INWOULDVE GAVE A QUARTER OF A STARBOR NON BUT U CANT 1-5 well this is 1/2 a star or negative 3stars!!! It‚Äôs that bad!! But their loss bc I would‚Äôve subscribed had it sent every 2wks forever but I guess scamming is easier and the fact amazon put their name on this one it‚Äôs horrible bc thought amazon checked before obviously NOT!!! DO NOT BUY DO KOT BELIEVE ANY THAT SAY ORIGINAL VERSION ETC NOT ALL BS AND WORSE WHICH DIDNT THINK THAT WAS POSSIBLE IT ABSOLUTELY IS OMG!! Horrible DO NOT BUY!! Their loss for scamming people!!

B01F1PNU00,Brad Howell,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2022",I don‚Äôt do many reviews BUT,First of all I had a sample of creed Adventus and I couldn‚Äôt get myself to buy a bottle of it because it only lasts 4-5 hours. If I‚Äôm spending 300+ on a bottle of cologne it should last much longer and not require so many sprays throughout the day to keep the scent going. I say a review about this perfect clone and I gave it a shot. I sprayed creed on one arm and this one on the other and couldn‚Äôt believe how it‚Äôs the same exact scent. Easy 95%. The Al haramain lasted 9 hours on my skin and people who know the creed scent when I wore solely the Al haramain said oh ur wearing creed I love that scent. I have many colognes by Parfumes De Marley and Xerjoff among others. I have a pretty big collection and yet this one is a top 5 without a doubt. Even if it was double triple the price it would be worth it. I would‚Äôve def spent the 300+ on the actual creed if it performed anything like the Al haramain. 2 thumbs up from me! Great quality and craftsmanship into this scent.

I had scrolled through Amazon and found this clone and decided to take a chance. The bottle was very nice in a case definitely fits the profile of a high-end fragrance. But when I smelled it OMG! It was absolutely amazing and unlike anything else that I have in my collection. All I know is that I don't have to buy the real thing nor do I care with the real thing smells like because this will blow your mind. As far as performance it's performed fairly good sprayed it on at about 5:30 in the morning worked all day came home and still had a light scent of it.

B01F1PNU00,Mark W. Hinderliter,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2023","Handsome, no cufflinks needed!","Sometimes citrus top notes turn me off, I don't want to tell the world ""hey! I showered!"" But the citrus top in L'Aventure is so integrated into the other facets that it all works together. It's hard to tease out individual notes, but all together it is a very elegant, sparkly scent with a downtown, masculine frame. It's clean and sophisticated with citrus zest and a smooth, urbane musk/leather/wood dimension. I can't think of an occasion it wouldn't be great to wear in. There is zero sweetness here."

But this is like a Zara's ""Vibrant Leather"" in steroids. It is a fantastic smell that I enjoy very much, and gets me compliments. I would recommend it , and I will buy another one when I finish this. And, if you take the price into consideration, that makes this perfume even better!"

B01F1PNU00,Edwin Sardena,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2022",Sweet and a light touch of smoke,"Smells excellent, more towards the sweet side of Aventus by Creed. It could be a little more smokey to make it more balanced i feel. The projection is good anywhere from 45 minutes to about an hour then i get a few whiffs of this scent every now and then. Becomes a skin scent in 4 to 5 hours. Overall a good blind buy. If this scent performed better, staying power of at least 8 or more hours. I would rate it as good as CDNIM, which is more smokey due to the birch note and lasts 8 to 10 hours for me. I have tried layering it under CDNIM, it does mellow out the harsh, lemony opening, which doesn't bother me, so that's an interesting subject to delve on as i have experimented layering fragrances such as Aventus with perfumo, wow!"

B01F1PNU00,C. Okamuro,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2019",Mixed feelings on this fragrance,"I was led to this fragrance through a circuitous route. I was listening to the Dan Le Batard podcast, which made mention of Creed Aventus. From there I went to a store and smelled Creed Aventus from a small decant, but decided it was just a little too indulgent for casual spending (especially since I don't wear cologne often). I settled on getting Al Haramain L'Aventure Eau de Parfum. While the 100ml was similar in cost to the ""real"" tiny decant, I just didn't like the value prospect of the authentic item.

As others have mentioned, the Al Haramain packaging is pretty nice. I'm largely unmoved by that, though, so I just look at it as a cost component that doesn't really add any value (YMMV). As for the scent, I purchased it without smelling it. Upon the item arriving, I quickly tried it out. My first impression was that it was about a 6/10 match. Once it ""settled"" (about 15 minutes after applying), it was about a 7/10 match. It seems to last about 2-3 hours, at least at the relatively conservative amount I put on.

This was my first experience with copycat/homage type scent. Honestly, I think I expected it to be a closer copy, but it's pretty nice in its own right. Would anyone confuse the two? It's hard to say, but I do think that the staying power of the cologne is a little disappointing. It's good for a dinner, but it's not going to last a long night. YMMV."

B01F1PNU00,Dominic P.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2018","Long lasting, amazing scent!","I purchased this cologne solely based on reviews. I never got to smell it until it arrived at my door. At first I thought the scent to be a little strong and was scared to show my wife, she has a sense of smell as good as a bloodhound, and hates all the colognes I pick so I usually need pre approval. (I took a chance and ordered without telling her.)

I decided to wear it to work since she is asleep when I leave in the morning. When I got home after the first day wearing it, I gave her a hug and kiss, she asked what kind of cologne I was wearing. That made me nervous.

I told her it‚Äôs new, and to my surprise she loves it. The smell is not overpowering but it is strong and lasts all day. I also purchased Club de Nuit Intense based on reviews, it has a similar smell. Not nearly as good of a cologne as L‚ÄôAventure.

This cologne is the best cologne I‚Äôve worn since Acqua di Gio. And is now my absolute favorite! I get compliments on it everyday.

B01F1PNU00,dnites,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2019",No idea what Aventus is but the scent is nice - with one major flaw,"Pre review:
After reading and watching lot of reviews parfumo/youtube... I set out to find the scent and try it out (to no avail). So I took it at face value and ordered blindly (never doing that again).
Review:
So I decided to try it out on a casual evening. The scent is really nice, instantly felt the citrus and was loving it. 20 or so minutes later I literally can't tell if I have any perfume on (my body spray - which is nothing special was more pronounced).
I brushed that off and decided to try it again a few days later. This time I was home the whole day and sprayed some on my inner wrist then started the stop watch on my phone.
25 minutes later and I can barely tell if I sprayed anything. I literally have to place my nose next to my skin (1cm or less) to find out where I sprayed.
The presentation is nice and yes the bottle is a fingerprint magnet(luckily I have really dry palms). The hinges on the box already showing signs of falling apart by the second use. Mine came with an extra sample which was a pleasant surprise.
I've given it two starts, 1 star for scent, 1 star for the free sample.
Rating for the perfume on its own, 0 stars.

P. S: I bought directly from Amazon not third party sellers to avoid any doubts. Only possible scenarios are:
1. I got a dud
2. Amazon sold me a fake
3. AL Harmain believe the hype and are now watering newer batches (majority of positive reviews are from 2017, 2018
BH: U 230818011604

TL;DR Nice scent, doesn't last long (20-30 mins max), presentation is good from afar, mine came with a free sample."

My wife ran away when I first sprayed this. I have Dior Sauvage. YSL L'Homme, Bulgari Aqua Amar and many other highly rated colognes. I'm not sure how I feel about this one. Right now as I'm sitting here as it dries down (about 15 mins dried down so far) it screams used car salesman. I'll see what happens as it keeps drying down. The wife did say its not as harsh but shes still not impressed. We'll see.

EDIT: You have to let this dry down before the smell really delivers. At first it's a disappointment then it turns into a hit if heaven. My wife smelled it after it dried down as well and she said she liked it more than almost all colognes I initially listed above. Good buy!"

B01F1PNU00,opcode,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2018","A good fragrance, just doesn't last very long","The biggest thing I don't like about this is that the performance/projection (sillage) is poor. I'm not sure if it is because of a reformulation or not, but the fragrance turns into a skin scent very quickly.

The fragrance is good. It does smell like Aventus, this is true. I own both.

The packaging is great. Yes, your fingers smudge up the mirrored-finish as others have said, but it's quite beautiful.

With L'Aventure, the initial application smells of citrus and you think you may have the wrong fragrance. Fear not. As it dries, almost if by magic, it becomes very Aventus-like and 99.9% of people will not be able to tell the difference. However, it's not a total Aventus clone. Side-by-side, there are hints of pepper that Aventus does not have.

For formal events, wear the real Aventus. If the cost is too much, then pay for a 2 ML or higher size decant. You don't need to pay $300 for a full bottle, just buy a decant online from Amazon.

I recommend this fragrance as a good everyday niche fragrance that is Aventus-like enough."

After 30 minutes, I kept sniffing where I sprayed, and could barely detect a scent. And this is with a generous 3-4 spritzes per area.

No doubt you'll want to utilize a portable atomizer, as you'll need to reapply this cologne throughout the day if you want it detected in any way after a short period of time. Love the smell, disappointed with its drydown strength. HTH."

B01F1PNU00,C. Gafton,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2018",Fairly well done copy,"This smells very much like Creed Aventus hrough and through. From the opening notes through dry down the only difference I can objectively point to doing the left arm/right arm smell test is in intensity and longevity. L'Adventure is somehwta of a softer blend and just a tad sweeter, and when compared side by side half an hour after application it gets clobbered in scent strength by Aventus. After about two-two and half hours L'Adventure is very faint, while Aventus is still going strong. But to its credit, L'Aventure maintains its scent profile all the way, so you can safely compensate by re-applying it every 3 hours or so. For the price being sold, it is a great bargain."

I sprayed 1 spray of each on opposites hands and let it sit for an hour. Do yourself a favor and save like 90% of your money and buy this. If you like Aventus this will get you in that same space for about 10% of the price. Very nice!
B01F1PNU00,D Janvrin,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2019","Quite nice - not too bold, yet long lasting","I'm familiar with Creed, but it's been a while since I tried Aventus & I won't make a comparison. L'Aventure is very nicely balanced with a fresh citrusy opening that transitions pleasantly to a long woodsy dry-down. I did not notice any particular 'musky' scent, but it does have a clean feeling to it. The base was moderately noticeable the next AM (24 hours)."
B01F1PNU00,Alvaro Angarita R.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2023","beware, lousy product","It is a mockery, I bought the perfume letting myself be carried away by comments and it is a lie, this product only has a good case, the fragrance does not exist, it does not have the smell, fragrance, fixation or anything that they offered..."

B01F1PNU00,DL,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2018",Good Aventus clone? Nope!,"If this is actually supposed to be an Aventus clone, it's not a good one. Why would you make a clone of Creed Aventus and replace the pineapple note with some kinda lemony citrus note? Bad decision. Okay, it smells a little similar to Aventus, but nowhere near as good. Even as it's own standalone scent, I don't care for it. Still waiting on a good Aventus alternative with a killer pineapple note. The best I've EVER smelled was Dua's Poseidon's Elixir 2.0, which is unfortunately discontinued."
B01F1PNU00,Rich,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2018",Amazing clone. Great smell,"Bought this because of the reviews and hype. I had never smelled Aventus before. Someone at work finally brought in a bottle of Creed Aventus and I did a wrist to wrist comparison. Aventus was different, sharper with more citrus within the first couple of minutes. L'Aventure initial spray is subdued in comparison. After about 5 minutes though I could not tell them apart. Amazing clone. Great smell, very masculine, good performance and a great price."

B01F1PNU00,Jeffery J. Ashlock,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2018",I will probably wear this at work and save the real for special occasions this is the best find thus far,This is the closest I‚Äôve smelled to Aventus by creed the top notes are slightly different not really detectable unless you wear aventus regularly as I do. Once it‚Äôs settled I couldn‚Äôt tell any difference on myself. Everyone‚Äôs chemistry is different so it may not be the same on you. I will probably wear this at work and save the real for special occasions this is the best find thus far. The bottle is great too and the price is right.

Sadly with this specific purchase I'm disappointed because the package seems to be leaking (the little bubbles you see on the lining) as for the smell. ITS amazing. It's what women smell like in the middle east. Which is amazing.

Im really sad that the product is leaking but the smell is great and for the price point.

The smell is like floral/fruity. Not too strong."

It has a very earthy oud woody smell so if that's your thing you'll love it. I don't understand how this perfume is classified as ""femme"" scent. This smells like it's suited more for a man/masculine presenting person. I wish I could return it. Even after the dry down it was too strong for my personal preference and within 20 mins my eyes were watering and my head hurt and that's with only ONE spray.

My guilty pleasure is perfume and I love the stuff and keep them all in pristine condition.
I thought I'd give o e of the oils a go and I chose this one purely because I liked the bottle lol. And I have to say it smells beautiful and with it being an oil it lasted for most of the day. I will say its not a perfume that is suited for the younger generation but for anyone else its perfect and a great price.
I'm sure other perfumes by this brand will have a perfume that is suited to everyone's taste.
Don't listen to negative comments as that's only one person's review and it's unfair to judge this brand on one bottle!!
Try for yourself...this ones not expensive and there are others that are higher in price and lower. Hope this helps!"

B00U93NHXU,Divascribe,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2023","Nice scent, but not quite the same","In the late ‚Äò70s and early ‚Äò80s, Aliage was my go-to scent. I loved its tart, grassy smell. It was different from any other scent I‚Äôd tried. It was also quite strong, so I only used a little of it at a time.

I just received my bottle of the current Aliage. It has a light floral scent and I will enjoy wearing it, but it‚Äôs not the same as the original scent. And actually, that may not be a bad thing. People aren‚Äôt as into strong scents these days and some are allergic, so it‚Äôs probably just as well that this is a lighter scent. I still have fond memories of the original, though."

Aliage has a very fresh, light scent with woodsy notes and floral tones. I cannot even guesstimate how many times through these many years I've had friends and complete strangers compliment me. It is my signature scent and I will never stray from using Aliage. Estee Lauder used to have gift packages with Aliage Dusting Powder, and a purse-sized spray. I'm very sorry Lauder stopped selling them quite a few years ago. I just wish I had a dollar for every compliment I have received through all these years! I've heard that Lauder has lightened the scent through the years. I think that may be true. I just know lots of other perfumes have come and gone, but Aliage, (thankfully), is still here!"

B01MSRH3RF,Shellapoo,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2023",So Comforting,"I recently added this little pretty to my collection, and I'm so glad I did. To me, it is comfort in a bottle. Evokes feelings of being in the most comfy of lounge wear, wrapped in a handmade quilt, snuggled on the couch, binge watching a favorite series or a movie marathon. My only tiny complaint is that the sillage is extraordinarily poor, and my perfume-eating-skin turns this into a skin scent almost instantly. But it is so soothing and calming, I just keep the bottle close by and respray often. Thankfully this one is affordable enough that I don't mind. Highly recommend!"

From the Body Shop's White Musk to the more contemporary Tom Ford White Suede. This perfume is BY FAR THE WORST musk perfume I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. How they managed to bottle the scent of the sadness and abandonment of a Senior Citizen home I will never know. That's what this perfume smells like. Broken dreams and adult diapers!

B000C1Z1B0,Cindo,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2023",Solid disappointment,"I wore this scent decades ago, although not often, so decided to give it a try again. Initially I think it smells like a stale perfume that makes me regret spraying it on my body/clothes. Then later I'll get a slight 'whiff' and it's almost pretty. I think 'hmm, maybe it's not so bad.' But there's NO longevity whatsoever. It's as though I didn't use it at all. It leads me to assume, then, that it's very diluted. Honestly I wish I could return it."

This one is ""Eau De Toilette"", which means it is water based. It is a much more diluted scent. I won't send it back because it was my oversight. It doesn't smell as yummy as the oil based version.

I bought it based on tons of great Amazon reviews and good reviews on perfume websites. I love perfumes with musk. This one is just yuck. It smells very powdery and is too mature smelling for my liking. It also smells cheap. Yes, I know it was inexpensive but there are ‚Äúcheap‚Äù perfumes out there that don‚Äôt smell so. As for longevity, I don‚Äôt know because I washed it off an hour after I applied it. Ugh. Is it giftable? I guess it may work for a mature woman in your life, your grandma or great grandma if you will be able to stand hugging her or being around her when she wears this scent. I‚Äôm surprised that this has so many great reviews. If you are looking for a good perfume with musk, my favorite is Clean Skin from Sephora. The only issue with the Clean Skin perfume is the longevity could be better. You can also find Clean Skin perfume on Amazon or on other perfume websites."

Amazon you should vet your 3rd party suppliers a lot better. I have been receiving a lot of crap products lately, most of them from China. A very bad reflection on you Amazon. If this sort of thing keeps up I will no buy from Amazon again.

Because I‚Äôm stuck with this big bottle of it, I keep spraying it hoping my nose wasn‚Äôt working right the last time, but it‚Äôs still disappointing. If you‚Äôre jonesing for a nostalgic feminine musk scent, you‚Äôre better off with Jovan white musk. The fragrance doesn‚Äôt last long, but it‚Äôs the same you remember.

B0C8YL925M,K. Conrad,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2023","More masculine than unisex, good staying power","This is a large bottle of eau de toilette! There is a lot in here for the money, thus a good value if you like the scent.

The scent itself seemed overly masculine. I realize it is described at ""unisex"", but that was not how it smelled to me.

In the bottle, it is strong, manly scent. Out of the bottle and on my skin, it is still strong.

Once the scent dries down after about 15 minutes, the initial strong manly type scent is not as overwhelming, but it does not mesh well with my chemistry and I still find it too strong.

I do not get a sense of flowers, nor oriental, just a musk with a little bit of maybe citrus? Either way, not great on me, but if you like strong musky man cologne scents, then this may be good for you.

Staying power is typical of an eau de toilette - noticeable for about an hour, then it dies down and slightly lingers for another hour. It isn't perfume, but lasts as expected for what it is."
B0C8YL925M,Kia Couture,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2023",Simple and long lasting,"I love trying new scents especially things that are a bit outside of what I normally purchase, I have a little over 60 perfumes and I break them into tiers of ""most used"", ""liked but not loved"", and ""to give away"" and this perfume is definitely going in the tier of ""most used"" and I just got it today. I'm going to separate my review into sections to make it easy to gather information for your purchase if you choose to purchase it.

The perfume's scent:
When you first spray the perfume it comes out in a really fine even mist and immediately you smell fresh pine; it's woody and light and not overpowering but it definitely takes the lead in the fragrance. While drying it has a slight sweetness of florals mixed in that pairs perfectly and adds a feminine element to a normally masculine pine note that we predominately see in men's fragrances.
When it dries down on FABRIC it still smells fresh and pine-y, almost citrus-y but not quite, and the cinnamon note isn't very present at all, I thought it smelled nice but I wouldn't call this a fragrance for everyone, that I would wear as a gourmand/florals fragrance loving woman.
NOW for the cool part.
I was spraying it on the burlap bag the perfume arrives in and reviewing it and decided to spray it on my skin to see how it worked with my body chemistry and I was extremely surprised. On my skin when it dried down I got this warmer earthy note mixed with cinnamon. It's sweet and slightly spicy and reminds me of an amber scent but not quite there. The dry down on skin for me makes the pine note almost an afterthought as the sweet florals and warm cinnamon take over and the pine shifts into an earthy woody blend instead of a pine needle scent (think forest not holiday).

Now I think we're all aware of the fact that everyone has a body chemistry that is different and how it smells on me may not be how it smells on you, but I will use this and wear it until there's nothing left... and then I'll go buy another bottle. It's mature and sophisticated without being powdery or musky. The sillage (scent trail that lingers behind you) isn't overwhelming and it being from the Middle East means that the essential oils they put in their fragrances guarantee a long-lasting potent perfume. You can under spray and it'll last all day.

Packaging/Giftability: The perfume arrives bubble-wrapped and inside a burlap bag with a business card with a QR code on it. Upon scanning the code you're sent to a website that tells you more about the company which was created by a DOCTOR who tells her story of creating products that are focused on natural ingredients that are effective, safe, and gentle for the skin. The company is in Israel so most of the writing on the site is in Hebrew, but when I accessed the site on my laptop I changed the language to English. They offer skin and body care as well as other fragrances, candles, diffusers, and soaps. If you have a luxurious friend who loves fragrances this would be a safe bet but I might get a gift bag for the product to sit in. If you have an eco-friendly holistic friend I think they'd enjoy this too."
B0C8YL925M,Darsir Tsaitz,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2023",Heavy scent. Large bottle. More masculine,"Review for AMA LURRA Unisec Perfume.

The smell is hard to describe but you could say it's floral or woody and ""dense"". It's a strong smell so definitely do not spray too much. I'd characterize it more as a masculine perfume than a unisex one (of course, to each their own). Compared to other perfumes and cologne, this didn't have a standout ""refined"" smell to me but it does still smell fairly good overall.

Overall, very subjectively speaking, it's just alright."
B0C8YL925M,N. J. LACROSS,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2023",A strangely good smelling scent,"This frag smells kind of strange - to me, I really like a lot of the fragrance, you can especially smell the cinnamon and it just smells so nice. But there's definitely a lot of synthetic and cheap smell in here as well, which is why I say strange, because despite smelling cheap, I kind of still really enjoy the smell. It lasted a long time for me, not super heavy but I could smell it off myself for 6-8 hours.

I think i'd recommend this to someone younger, as it overall smells youthful by smelling a bit cheap. But i'd suggest anyone whos interested in interesting frags give this a try at a good price."
B0C8YL925M,PDP,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2023",Fairly Pleasant Scent ‚Äì Warm & Bold With Lighter Sweet & Floral Notes,"This is a fairly pleasing cologne. It‚Äôs kind of hard to describe, but what I‚Äôve noticed so far is that it has an initially bolder and almost woody scent, but then I get some aroma of spice. After that, I pick up on some sweeter and lighter floral notes. I think it‚Äôs well balanced, but it‚Äôs not something you‚Äôd want to use and hope not to be noticed. It is fairly powerful, and the fragrance endures pretty well. The bottle comes WITHOUT a cap, but in a nice burlap drawstring bag. To me, this might make a nice Christmas gift, or a winter birthday gift. For some reason, it doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúsummertime‚Äù to me, but it may be more suited for a cold wintery day occasion."

To me it's something I'd be more likely to wear in fall/winter. The scent is quite strong and it lasted most of the day. It comes in a little burlap bag with a pull tie which is a nice initial presentation. However, it comes without a cap for the bottle.

B0C8YL925M,ThePlainOldT,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2023","Smells okay, but very strong! Missing top... Purposeful, or accidental? Crooked and looks cheap.","This AMA LURRA A NATURAL TALE MAYIM Unisex Perfume for Women & Men is a perfume that leans a bit more to the masculine side, but smells okay. It is definitely one that you would want to spray and walk, not run into, as it is quite strong. I don't get the warm cinnamon notes, but more of a somewhat sharp citrus, along with some florals, and a bit of powderiness.
It arrives in a nice burlap bag, with the name on the front, and ribbon pull ties at the top. It's a nice touch and looks a bit rustic. The listing mentions a clean spray top, but it just looks odd. The neck of the spray top on the bottle I received is quite crooked. I'm not sure if the top being ""clean"" is purposeful, or an accident that they are trying to market as something new and innovative. It just looks unfinished, oddly shaped, and comes off as looking rather cheap.
The fragrance smells okay, if you go very easy with it, it lasts for most of the day, and comes in a good sized bottle. I don't like the fact that there is no top, as it looks like I just lost it somewhere. It is not a bottle that I would want to place on my perfume display shelf."
B0C8YL925M,LynnMarie,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2023",Intriguing and truly unisex fragrance,"Ama Lurra MAYIM Eau de Toilette spray fragrance is one of those fragrances that probably smells different and unique on everyone. I took a chance on it because a heavy floral scent can give me a migraine, but I was drawn to the idea of cinnamon and pine. Happily, I got no headache from it. When I first sprayed lightly, my first impression was that it was too masculine. However, when it dried down and reacted with my body chemistry warmer notes came through and I find it to be a very inviting fragrance. That makes me very curious as to how this would smell on a man. It‚Äôs hard for me to pick up the cinnamon perhaps because it is mixed with pine. This could be too heavy a scent if not worn somewhat sparingly. And it does last the entire day. In that respect it‚Äôs more like a perfume than an eau de toilette. I am really going to enjoy this as a winter fragrance because of the warmer notes. I think the lack of a cap and the burlap pouch gives it a deliberately unfinished bohemian vibe. I also think it could make a cool couples gift. Highly recommend this unique fragrance."

However, it is incredibly strong. The scent itself is not offensive. It‚Äôs a very deep woodsy scent that I would associate with the colder months and it‚Äôs a more masculine/unisex scent. I didn‚Äôt give this a higher rating because of the strength of this perfume being overwhelming. I don‚Äôt think that this would be easy to practically use unless you want to smell like a grandma who reeks of perfume. You could perhaps put this in a different bottle that sprays less at a time and perhaps you could control it more, however for me this is a miss. I would not recommend this perfume to others."

I tried using about the same amount and noticed, right away, that something was different! I could barely smell that wonderful scent.

Since it is an eau de toilette it doesn't last long at all, even for a light scent. It does seem extra watered down. The rose scent is so, so slight and just perfect. It's not overly floral and fakey like cheaper perfumes. I hope they continue to make this one and have some parfums, and not just the toilettes...."

B0791XHYV7,Felicia George,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2020",Too expensive for such little product...,"I really like this scent, it has nodes of vanilla and obviously rose. It kinda gives a vintage nostalgia scent, like a hippie would wear it but also like a millionaire would wear it. The spray doesn't last long, you have to re-spray it every 25-30 minutes if you want to keep its full scent. The biggest downside to this product is that it is such a little bottle for such a ""high"" price. And yes I know it's a philosophy scent and the brand is expensive anyhow, but this is a different scenario. The whole bottle including the top is only about the size of a burts bees chapstick, and because of the curve in the bottle the product is only about the size of sample sizes of perfumes you can get at Sephora. Besides the price, I would highly recommend this product to any age group."

B09CTSG37T,Corbett313,"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2023",Amazing,"It‚Äôs supposed to be a Blue de Chanel EDP clone. It‚Äôs very close but slightly‚Äù brighter‚Äù to me. While the original is slightly ‚Äúsmoother‚Äù. Those are the best words I can use to describe it. I‚Äôm not the fragrance guy, that can tell you all the notes in it, but I love this! I‚Äôve had a few people tell me that they like it more than the original. On my skin, it only gets good projection for about four hours but it‚Äôs cheap enough where that‚Äôs acceptable."
B09CTSG37T,Ling Lang,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2023",Great smell with decent projection,"Smells great, what it lacks in projection it makes up for with duration.15 hours after application and still a nice subtle flash every so often. Smells different on skin and pronounces itself more with perspiration."

B09CTSG37T,#‚Ññ.w1n00%‚Ñ¢,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2023","Al Haramain ~ Amber Oud, Carbon Edition ‚âà An, old~man scented, clone of, Creed, Green Irish Tweed.","üó®Ô∏èMy, reviews/opinions ‚âà truthfully and honestly, assessed, through my knowledge and experience, with, this fragrance.

üëÉüèΩScent ‚âà A decent scent. Just isn't for me. To me, the opening is, analogous to, Davidoff ~ Cool Water. The mid is, somewhat consonant to, Creed ~ Green Irish Tweed‚Äôs mid. But... The dry down is, reminiscent, of a church, and/or, old~man smell.

ü¶æPerformance ‚âà As an, {EdP}, it's powerful, as expected. Decent sillage. The, atomizer/sprayer, is pressurized, and, works really well.

üí®Projection ‚âà About arms length. Or, maybe... 6~8 ft. radius.

‚è±Ô∏èLongevity ‚âà Full~Time job @ 8~10 hrs. on my skin. Overtime of, 12+ hrs. on, clothes.

üåÑ VersatilityüåÉ ‚âà I.M.O... I believe, anyone can wear any, fragrance, they want to... whenever, wherever, and for, whatever. But... In retrospect, I would say, whenever you want to smell like an, old~man, or, the inside of a, church.

üíµPrice/Valueüè∑Ô∏è ‚âà Exorbitantly overpriced. Especially... for a, 2.0 oz. bottle, of this type of, scented fragrance. Now... As far as, the value of the product, and/or, presentation of, A.H.A.O.C.E. I'd say, the price is somewhat fair.

üì¶Product ‚âà Very nice. The bottle of fragrance, is embedded snuggly, into a, submergered, outline of the bottle, on the inside of the box. Of which... The box is a, gray~ish, wooden box, that, lifts open. On the lid of the box is a, metal, carbon printed, plate. With... The name printed, onto, the metal plate. The bottom of the box, as well as, the Inside of the box, are both lined with, black felt. The bottle is, glass, that, is see through on the, sides and back. With... A metal, carbon printed, plate, on the front of the bottle. As of which, at the bottom of the plate, the name, is printed onto. The bottle has a, metal cap, that, instead of printed, has the name embossed, into, the top of the cap. Which... Snaps tightly, into place. Also, the bottle has a pressurized, atomizer/sprayer, that works really well."

Well balanced. I ordered it based on reviews mentioning longevity and believing it was an eau de Parfum, but it's clearly only a cologne. I don't get any duration with it.

Never again! do not buy from 3rd party sellers on this site. Amazon does nothing to screen their sellers.

B08V5Q9XGR,TM Conway,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2023",So lovely (but short-lived),"I'm disappointed because I do love this scent but it doesn't last long enough for me to get through all the notes. It was a blind buy because I saw a video where a reviewer talked about the ""powdery-vanilla"" vibe that I love. By the way, I don't get ANY of the ""Guaiac wood, White Musk, Jasmine, & Nagarmotha"" shown on the product page and Fragrantica has a much better description of the scent accords.

My immediate impression is that there is a burst of sweet musky powder with a tiny hint of cashmere (???). Then it's gone before I get a chance to notice any bergamot, orange, or more than the tiniest note of pear. I guess this will end up being a hair scent for me.

I've seen other reviews online saying that this lasts & lasts so I think it's a body chemistry thing. And the bottle is heavy and very pretty in an understated way."

This ""Ana Abiyedh"" is a soft, pear-vanilla-musk combination that goes on smooth and lasts all day and all night. Next to my ""Dior Homme Intense"" it is one of the only fragrances I do not have to re-apply halfway through the day. It projects strongly for the first three hours, then settles down to an arm-length bubble of soft warm pear-vanilla heaven. If you've ever had pear ice cream, you will have an idea of what this fragrance smells/tastes like.
This fragrance is perfectly unisex due to the feminine softness of the vanilla and pear, and the masculine strength of the musk and woody notes. It's a perfect fruity-creamy-woody fragrance...and I've only found one other like it in my entire fragrance journey (Dior Homme Intense). The fact that Lataffa created this for such a great price only makes it more astounding!

B08373C266,Lcastil,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2023",Review from a sensitive nose,"I always mention that I have a sensitive nose. Not in the way that scents overpower me, but in a way where I can identify ingredients in food as well as certain chemicals and if fruit or veggies are ripe.
The review: First off, the bottle y'all. It's so beautiful. It has gold, a teal color we see in vintage glass bottles. The cap has pearls and it swirls and it has bling. I never associate the bottle with the fragrance bc the bottle is supposed to be eye catching to the consumer, BUT, this one does very much describe the fragrance. It is very wispy, clean, crisp and sophisticatedly layered. I tried the scent on paper and then on my skin and got just slight variations of the smell.
The smell- It's crisp citrus right out of the bottle and then the floral- rose- seems to swirl into the citrus that reminds me of the shape of the cap. Then the playfulness of the clean citrus and feminine floral is met with sandalwood and a light oud. It seems to almost have a white musk or very very light powdery scent that softens the edges a bit- the oud I'm sure. There is a brown sugary/ caramel smell at base of it.
This scent is not at all sweet or as potent like other scents from the House of Lataffa. You might need to refresh this one or be more generous during application if you like it like its other house fragrances.
I do see this as being able to be used for both men and women. It is a smell that can be used by masculine presenting people. It does have a sultry aspect to it. It's fresh and clean but the base notes gives it a confidence and depth without taking the crisp and floral from it. I can see this being layered to make a scent cleaner and lighter.
For those that want a visualization of the smell- . This smell is casual walk through the citrus orchard that goes on to have a creamy dessert at an outdoor bistro table that ends in flirtatious seduction. You want some adventure and fun; you want to laugh but doors should definitely be opened for you. Or you should be doing the opening of the doors because this scent is complex but still very centered and put together.
So that is how it smells to me. I really enjoyed it and look forward to wearing it."
B08373C266,Elizabeth Bonanno,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2023",It's Beautiful But Not For Me," I really wanted to love this and when I opened the box I was floored ... the bottle is gorgeous! It has all the notes I love and so I assumed it would be a perfect fit for me, but it's not. That being said - I think a lot of people would love it. The dry down is very white floral and patchouli. If that's your vibe you'll adore this. It smells very expensive."
B08373C266,Andrea C.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2023",Sweet citrus,"This perfume is so delicious, I‚Äôm very impressed. The opening is citrusy coming from sweet fruits such as mandarin/orange and the tasty bergamot, developing to a sweet jasmine which I love, and the dry down is sweet and woody with a bit of patchouli. It is not overwhelming, it is a very elegant scent. I think the projection is moderate the first 2-3 hours, then it lowers a bit but you can still smell yourself and others will, when they get close to you.
I highly recommend this frangance, it‚Äôs clean, it‚Äôs definitely unisex, it will make you feel sophisticated."

It has quickly become my go-to fragrance for everyday wear. The scent is a perfect blend of sweet and floral, with hints of musk and vanilla that make it so alluring and captivating.

I love how long-lasting the scent is, and how it lingers on my skin for hours after application. It's also not too overpowering, which is great because I can wear it to work or out with friends without worrying about it being too strong.

The packaging is also beautiful and elegant, making it a great gift option. I've received so many compliments on this perfume, and I always recommend it to anyone looking for a new scent to add to their collection.

Overall, I can't recommend Andaleeb perfume enough. It's the perfect scent for anyone who loves a sweet and floral fragrance that is long-lasting and not too overpowering. If you're looking for a new perfume to try, definitely give Andaleeb a chance - you won't be disappointed!"

B08HZYJJMT,Rosanna,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2023",Yummy,"This is almost exact to the pricier brand it‚Äôs inspired by. Long lasting, it smells exactly like a discontinued perfume I had back when Payless shoe stores sold fragrances as well. Love it.."
B08HZYJJMT,Izzy,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2023",Quality fragrance,"I LOVE this fragrance! It‚Äôs a perfect sweet, delicious smell but it isn‚Äôt too overwhelming.

B08HZYJJMT,Anna,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2023",Obsessed,This perfume is everything! I have fallen in love with this brand and made it a mission to collect all of their fragrances. They are just so good. This one is like the perfect summer romantic perfume without being overly sweet or coconutty. I receive compliments every time I wear it and the scent lasts all day. Perfect price point for just a really good scent to wear.

B08HZYJJMT,Anna,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2023",Smells good,It's a nice scent at a good price.. My box arrived soaked and the bottle nearly half empty which is unfortunate. With the long wait but good price/nice scent and near half empty bottle I'm on the fence about ordering again.
B08HZYJJMT,Crystal,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023",Great clean and carefree scent!,"Summer Fling by Anecdotes is an enchanting fragrance that instantly transports you to carefree summer days. Its top notes of citrus and tropical fruits create a refreshing burst of energy, while the floral heart notes add a touch of romance. As the fragrance settles, the warm base notes of vanilla and musk linger, leaving a comforting and sensual trail. Perfect for those seeking a delightful summer escapade in a BIG bottle. For the price it‚Äôs an amazing every day scent to throw in your gym bag and lasts longer than any B&BW spray. Hands down a more sophisticated smell that has more longevity than any body spray."
B08HZYJJMT,Amanda Brunson,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023",Smells Incredible!! Sol De Janeiro Dupe,This is spot on. Only reason it‚Äôs getting 4 stars is because my bottle leaked and soaked the entire package in perfume. Not sure on longevity yet but it smells so so good!

B08HZYJJMT,JH_20,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2023",Omg,"Smells incredible!
Very strong when you first spray it but quickly fades to a nice background scent, which is good for me because I get headaches from strong smells.
Absolutely adore this scent and cannot wait to try others by the brand."
B08HZYJJMT,Summer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2023",Tiktok made me buy it but...,"I don't hate this product. In fact, my younger sister loves it. But that's my reason for rating a 3-star--the smell is very juvenile and smells cheap. The white musk notes are very potent and then there is just a hint of coconut. The other reviews have mentioned how it smells like summer in a bottle. It does, but it also smells cheap. In fact, I can always tell when someone is wearing it.

However, I do think this perfume makes a great layering contribution. I will layer this under sweeter musky perfumes and tropical scents (Clean Reserve Skin and even the Billy Eilish No 1 perfume). It works great with other perfumes in a similar scent family, but on its own, I am not a fan."
B08HZYJJMT,Mariana,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2023",Longer lasting sol de Janeiro perfume,"This smells exactly like the orange color sol de Janeiro body spray that‚Äôs overpriced at Sephora.

B08HZYJJMT,Ily,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2023",Big and spicy,The quality is very good for the price. It comes in a huge jar and the smell last for hours.

It‚Äôs a decent dupe for Sol de Janeiro, but the scent doesn‚Äôt last long, so if you‚Äôre okay with that, I‚Äôd be prepared to add this to your work tote to re-apply during the day."
B08HZYJJMT,alh79,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2023",This scent brings me joy,There are very few of the Anecdote fragrances I don't like. Carnival Day is probably my favorite. It's playful and musky and sweet but not too sweet. The fragrance is long lasting. I can smell it on myself all day. Every time I get a whiff I just feel happy. Love this scent
B08HZYJJMT,Stacy and Josh,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2023",Summer Fling- It‚Äôs AHHHHMAZING,"OH MY GOD! Is exactly what my husband said when I first sprayed it on.

This smells like a vanilla cupcake or a sweet vanilla scent for a younger girl. I was looking for something more beachy/salty/coconutty but this scent is still good, just not what I expected. GREAT size for the price, the packaging is cute and no damaged or expired parts/product. Willing to try the other scents!"
B08HZYJJMT,anon,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2022","Smells amazing, just doesn‚Äôt last super long on my skin","I saw this product on TikTok for Sol de Janeiro dupe. It smells amazing, lasts much longer than the original and is a great price. The product does not last super long on my skin, but most perfumes don‚Äôt last too long on me. It does smell super similar to Sol de Janeiro, I honestly can‚Äôt tell the difference. If I smelt this and someone told me it was Sol de Janeiro, I would believe them."
B08HZYJJMT,Fredrick,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2023","Nice fragrance, poor packaging quality","I've ordered anecdote fragrances a few times from different vendors. On multiple occasions I've received leaky bottles that have soiled the packaging with leaked fragrance and broken atomizers.

B08HZYJJMT,Maria Nunez,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2021",Sultry summer,"If you are someone that has a wardrobe of perfume this should be adding to your collection.

B08HZYJJMT,Lisa Mextorf,"Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2022",Not coconut/citrus at all!,"The scent is definitely more vanilla musk.

This smells like if you went to go visit your great Aunt Mertle at the convalescent home and she said ' hey sweetie, I've got something good for you in my purse, go grab it"".
You walk over to her closet and look around. You dont see it, then you look down. Its sitting on the ground next to a box of moth balls.
You grab the purse, hand it over and she starts looking through it. She pulls out an apple from the last time she snagged from the fruit bar at pandarosa back in '98. ""Ohhh, i forgot about that!""
Tosses it in the trash and continues to rummage through her bag. She then pulls out a yellow candy in a wrapper that looks a little sus. Is it...or excuse me...WAS IT...lemon or butterscotch? You'll never know.
'Here you go sweetie, just for you"". You say thank you and shove that ish in your pocket, never to see the light of day again.

I love that this perfume is vegan and free of parabens, phthalates, propylene glycol, gluten, & harsh dyes. It's a pale, pale yellow in color (I'm not sure why it looks honey colored in the pic).

B000IHVWKC,Adrienn,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2023",Watered Down,"I have been wearing this perfume for over 20 years. I know exactly what it should smell like and I know exactly what color it should be. When I open the box, I immediately knew that something was off. The color of the perfume was off. When I sprayed it on my arm, I first smelled an alcohol smell. with the real angel perfume there is no alcohol smell. This perfume is cheaper than most but now I know why.
I posted a picture to compare the color. You should have a blue tint to it. The perfume I got does not."
B000IHVWKC,Elizabeth Welsh Cousins,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2017",I think it was meant to be and I am looking forward to a long relationship with my NBS ‚Äì New Best Scent ANGEL,"A friend of mine introduced me to Angel via a pix. About a month later I went to a medical facility and I asked the nurse what she was wearing and she said, Angel. Later that day I ordered it. The day after I received it I went food shopping and someone was wearing it. I recognized the scent and struck up a long conversation with the woman who said she has been wearing Angel for 17 years. She told me to look in the box for an envelope!! What that I would have all these Angel encounters in such a short space of time? I think it was meant to be and I am looking forward to a long relationship with my NBS ‚Äì New Best Scent ANGEL!!"

B000IHVWKC,Barbara M.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2018",This is a fake!,"Enjoyed this for just one year and then the spray stopped working and the perfume discolored to a greyish blue. It still smells like Angel and I got many many compliments but basically it is a fake. When I took it to Macys to see if they could replace it for me, they told me that Mugler never made a bottle with this design/cap. And only now that I'm trying to open the cap to see why it won't spray do I realize that the top is sealed, so it's NOT a refillable bottle. All of the packaging and design looks like TM's and there's even a code inside the box. But, bottom line, it's a fake. Well, at least I got a year out of a $55 bottle when the real stuff sells for close to $150. Shame on you, Amazon for representing vendors who sell counterfeit materials. You need to do a better job of documenting your vendors!!"

B000C21BT0,Beth,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2023",Great smelling perfume,I have been using this fragrance for years and get so many compliments. It is a soft clean fragrance that stays with you all day. This is my 2nd time ordering from this seller HIGHLY recommend this seller is excellent.
B000C21BT0,Vicarrion,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2018",No code this time,"I first purchased this (Angel 1.7 oz EDP spray) over a year ago and it came with a code you can register on the Mugler website. This time around, I purchased from the same listing, the Prime eligible one that is fulfilled by Amazon, hovering right around $50. Upon opening this box, however, there is a sticker with a barcode (no numbers) over the spot where the registration code would have been. I went to the website to see if they are doing some kind of barcode scanning registration now, but no, they are not; they still ask for the ""unique code"" which is 11 digits.

Ultimately I'm not sure if this means it is a fake or if the seller takes the codes out for whatever reason. I did compare this bottle to my previous (empty) bottle and they are exactly the same, with the only exception being a number printed on the back of the bottle just below the cap - they are two different numbers, but the font and color of the text is the same. This seems normal as it's possibly a unit number or batch number, who knows.

So far I have only just sprayed it once. The button you push to spray is a bit hard to press and sticks a little - it smells good, familiar, deep and kind of spicy, if that makes sense. It was very strong when I first sprayed it, but thankfully did not have the alcohol scent that you sometimes get with perfume. I'm not exactly a perfume connoisseur, but if there is any difference here in smell it is too minimal for me to notice. Then again, it has been a long time since I've worn this fragrance, so like I said, I can't be 100% certain.

I guess I knew going into this purchase that I was taking my chances. I figured that I had had a good result previously so I hoped I would again. While $50 is steep for a fake, it's a steal for a real (ha). I can't afford the full retail price in stores anyway, so whether it is real or fake, hopefully I can just convince myself that it is legit and enjoy it just the same.

If I notice anything odd going forward I'll update this review."
B000C21BT0,Donnabrook,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2021",THE ABSOLUTE BEST PURCHASE EVER !!!!,"This product deserves 10+ stars , This perfume is ABSOLUT ELY DEVINE & CERTAINLY A HEAD TURNER! Be prepared because once you wear this you are sure to get TONS OF COMPLIMENTS!

Angel is certainly a head turner & conversation starter :) The scent is not overwhelming .. Just enough scent that you can smell & other's do too. This perfume is long lasting & by far the absolute best purchase that I have EVER MADE while trying to find just ""The Right Scent"" My family & friends all compliment me every single time that we are together .. Saying that perfume was ""Made For Me"", LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT !!

Please don't be hesitant about the price as it is a little pricey for perfume .. Once you pump one spray you will find that the product is WELL WORTH THE MONEY SPENT!!! This is certainly a KEEPER & IT IS ABSOLUTELY DEVINE!"

B000C21BT0,f5mando,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2013",Review A Fragrance? Really?!,"If you like the fragrance, it's great. If you don't, you'll hate it. My wife loved the smell of this on a friend of ours, and couldn't stop praising it. Neither of us are particularly enamored with most perfume, the majority of which I fond distracting (not in a good way) or just plain pungent. We sample-checked Angel when we passed through a dept. store a week or so after meeting with the aforementioned friend on a flying visit. With the wife's birthday imminent, and my reluctance to fork over the department store price, I placed an order here. I admit that I was somewhat wary, as it cost so much less from this seller than from the other sellers listed. My fears were allayed when the package arrived on her birthday (phew). It was the real thing, and I scored major 'good and thoughtful husband' points on this gift!
Tip: Go try it in a store to see if it works on you as well as it does on the person you smelled it on when you thought you liked it.
ANGEL is a sophisticated, light, unobtrusive fragrance, with lemony undertones. It mellows into it's fragrance pocket a minute or two after application.
*Make sure you get the one in the star-shaped bottle. The other (square/oblong) one is entirely different."

B000C21BT0,Lori H.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2013",I was nervous after reading some other reviews...,"After reading some of the other reviews, I was nervous that I might get a Knock-off of the real Angel. I have been wearing Angel for 7 years now. I was happy when I received the package (which was delivered in a short time) The box and wrapping were the same as what I have seen with all my purchases in the past from Macy's, etc.. The box was wrapped in plastic with the tell-tale sticker on the end. Upon opening, the only thing that bothered me was that the cardboard insert was damaged. It looked as if someome took the Angel star bottle and crammed it in the box crushing the cardboard. I know that the TRUE Angel packaging company would NOT let this leave the their plant this way...
The scent smells like Angel, but not as lasting. I am using it and learning my lesson. I would NOT purchase this perfume again from this seller."

The one that I had before this one was the largest one, which is not portable unless you have a huge purse with you. This one is compact enough to carry. For those who have not tried Angel, it is a rich scent, that includes notes of patchouli, vanilla, and a little bit of chocolate! I KNOW this is why my husband loves it!

B000C21BT0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2018",Concerns about authenticity of this product.,"I am pretty sure that the bottle that I received was counterfeit, despite buying directly from Amazon. I have been buying this perfume since it launched in 1992, and I am very familiar with the product.

I usually buy it in a local department store, but was happy to find it on here. I thought that buying from Amazon, and not a third party seller, would ensure authenticity, but that isn't the case.

The box that I received was wrapped in loose cellophane, sealed with a sticker. It was very easy to open without showing damage. The box looked authentic, but has all the bar codes cut out, and replaced with stickers, and the box itself has been cut open to remove the unique codes printed inside. Without those codes, the product can't be registered on the Mugler site.

The bottle looks close to authentic, but the sprayer on top is cheaply made and doesn't line up properly. My authentic bottles purchased directly from Mugler or from a Clarins counter have all had sturdy, cleanly former sprayers that lined up perfectly. The bottle does have an etched batch code, which matches the batch code on the box, but this code appears to be invalid. It doesn't match any batch made by Mugler/Clarins.

I did try a spray of the perfume, hoping for the best case scenario (the bottle was gray market, with identifying codes stripped so that they can't be traced to the original retailer). The perfume smelled sharper and more ""green"" than my authentic bottle purchased two months ago. The dry down was reasonably close to authentic, but it faded completely within two hours. I wear this perfume regularly, and the authentic EDP always lasts 8+ hours with my skin chemistry.

Worst case, it's counterfeit, possibly in reused packaging. Best case, it's gray market what was stored improperly and has suffered heat/age-related damage. I would not buy again."

All it takes is one spray on the wrist, and then I rub it on my neck and chest. The fragrance lasts all day long. This product is completely authentic, not unlike other products you might buy from online discounters. I am very pleased with my amazon purchase and will be purchasing again. The one thing you should be sure to do before purchasing any perfume, go to an actual store and try it on first. Apply the perfume to your inner wrist, let it sit for at least 20 minutes, and then smell it. Each perfume will work differently with your body chemistry. What smells good in the bottle or on someone else, may smell horrible on you."

If you're buying it as a ""blind"" purchase you're being foolish. Buy your first bottle in a store where you can sample.
I don't doubt that an occasional purchase results in a spoiled, mishandled, or improperly stored product. But, let's get a grip. If you're neurotic and will doubt the wisdom of an online purchase, shop locally. Otherwise, this is certainly worth the savings and hopefully, if you get unlucky, you can return it for refund or replacement."

I am very happy with my choice.
Angel is soft and feminine with notes of chocolate desserts and sandalwood along side a powdery finish that lingers. It lasts all day, but is not over powering (as long as you don't bathe in it).
I find myself sniffing my own wrist again and again to enjoy it's sweet smell.
The deeper notes in Angel make its more suited for nighttime in the Summer, or anytime wear for Fall or Winter.

I have been searching for a new ""signature fragrance"" and I believe I have found it in Angel."

Angel is the scent. It is a very rich scent filled with hints of chocolate. I think it smells really sensual on my wife, more importantly, she loves it. It is surely a beautiful smell but I would recommend that you sample it in person because the chocolate notes may not be to your taste. But if you want to expand your perfume repertoire then this is surely a step in the right direction.

WOW!!! Here's the response I received from DEAD SEA BEAUTY regarding my request to obtain a refund from them:

Dear Customer,

Thank you for the email. From the comment we can see this item has been used, is that correct? Please know that only brand new, unused, and unwrapped items may be returned. Please know you received the correct spray and it does not in any way smell in a negative manner. It is the original perfume and it is not defective in any way. Any claims that it smells like ""bug spray"" are absurd. As per our return policy, used items may not be returned or exchanged. We are very sorry but since the item has been used, we are unable to issue a refund. Thank you.

SO IN OTHER WORDS...they do NOT stand behind their product! So how was I to smell the perfume, thorough the box?

I filed a claim with Amazon and will be contacting the Better Business Bureau. I know what this perfume is SUPPOSED to smell like, I have a bottle of it left over which I purchased in person at Macy's. This is VERY BAD business and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND people NOT to purchase anything from this BOGUS COMPANY.

I received the 1.7 oz bottle of Angel perfume. Mind you I still have some left over from the bottle I purchased from Macy's. Their (Dead Sea Beauty) bottle smells like BUG SPRAY! I had 3 other people smell my wrists. Left wrist with Macy's Angel perfume and right wrist with Dead Sea Beauty perfume and all 3 people agreed my right wrist smelled like bug spray."

B000C21BT0,Steven B.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2015",FragranceNet: BEWARE. FAKE.,"I've always had a half trust for FRAGRANCENET, without having bought any of their merchandise.
Why, you ask?
Because of their great reputation, having loads of positive feedback and being Google trustworthy. I would often find myself by my computer on their website, looking at a world of discounted perfume. In awe at how much money I'd save.

Let me tell you: you get what you pay for. I received the so-called ""Angel"" perfume by Theirry Mugler from Fragrancenet.
It came in plastic wrapping, and what seemed like an authentic box. When I opened this box, things started to get sketchy. Supposedly with every Thierry Mugler perfume, you're supposed to receive a code printed on the upper inside portion of the box. This code was clearly cut out. Also what was the ""Made in France"" label on the side of the box was also cut out. Downright sketchy for nothing but a ""100% authentic"" perfume, Fragrancenet claims.
And while the bottle seemed to be proper in shape, the actual scent was awful. It smelled like a cheap, watery, and nauseating version of the actual Angel I've smelled in stores.
In stores it smelt fresher, spicier and softer. This one was just loud and made me want to barf.
While I couldn't return it, because it was ""hazardous material"", I was extremely dissatisfied with my purchase. Maybe this Angel perfume was just old or plain old fake. Will never buy from Fragrancenet again. Period.
Spend the extra $$$, it's well worth your time and money."

B000C21BT0,Born Momma,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2017",Poor Quality,"I have been wearing this perfume for years and have ordered it from Amazon on more than one occasion with no problem. This time, however, was a different story. The perfume is not blue, as it is supposed to be, but is green and does not smell normal. Also, the original packaging appears to have been tampered with where the product is described. Either this is a knock off or the perfume is defective. This item is not able to be returned. Be wary when ordering this perfume!!!! I will not order perfume from Amazon again.
UPDATE 6/6/2017: Amazon customer service replaced the bottle and the new bottle I received was perfect and not counterfeit. The box did not appear to have been tampered with like in my original product. I will never order this product from Amazon again, but they did correct the situation."

The package was sent with plastic bags you use receive from a grocery store as packing material. I still have the plastic bag to prove it. To make matters worse, the item was opened, which presents the question, is this legitimate. This is for a birthday present for my children's mother, so my concern is related to her health. Is it safe to use this product? I would like a response from the company guaranteeing that the item is legitimate. Otherwise, I would like to return the item.

B002Z7FVTQ,Zoom zoom,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2021",It‚Äôs My Fav!!!!! Scent doesn‚Äôt last long. *Updated,"It just came today and I‚Äôm so happy. I initially discovered this scent through Scentbird subscription through the mail. After it was gone I kept the empty perfume just to smell it, I knew I had to get the big one. I‚Äôm not kidding you‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm married but when I am out and about I have had a handful of men at different times ask what perfume I had on. I just absolutely love it and cannot describe it. They put everything I like in this. I hope it lasts more than a few hours. I know the perfume lasts longer but I can‚Äôt find it anywhere. I just worked out, showered and I had to put a little on as I‚Äôm getting ready for bed. I LOVE THIS PERFUME.

Ok third update. It doesn‚Äôt have the 3 and it‚Äôs not the real deal. The other reviewers who said this is NOT authentic AND does not last for hours are CORRECT. It lasts 2 hours and as you could see from my bottle it doesn‚Äôt say 3.

Last update because the seller got back to me when I complained they didn‚Äôt send the 3. They said they (D&G) have changed the label. I don‚Äôt know if that is the truth or not but he sent a link. I will say my scentbird one didn‚Äôt last long either. I love this perfume or toilette whatever it is, but it is a short lived scent on the skin."

The pink bottle is pretty and yes, it is giftable, but the top looks oddly like a black screw top off of a kerosene can. The first time I smelled the scent I was shocked at the harshness, but two disclaimers: one, after having COVID I know my ability to smell accurately is messed up, and two, it has really grown on me and now I wear it daily for a long lasting fresh scent."

I even sent a message to the seller. I've never owned a store bought bottle, only smelled at ulta and sephora, but after spraying it on my skin in store and knowing it smelled good and worked with my body chemistry, I wanted to get it. It doesnt last the longest, but neither did the one that I sprayed on me in the store. It's a light summery scent with fruity undertones but also and expensive smelling vibe. For the price I can reapply. I even bought some travel atomizers that work great to keep in my purse and reapply. Would recommend. And I would buy again from this seller."
B002Z7FVTQ,Eleanor,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2022",I adore this perfume,I tried this at Sephora a while ago and I remembered of it at random while shopping on Amazon so I searched for it here. To my surprise it was the real deal at a fraction of the price.
B002Z7FVTQ,Michele,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2012",Delicious smell!!!!,"I absolutely love this perfume. I'm yet to wear it for a full day but I just checked how it smells upon receiving it and I love it! I can absolutely imagine that this will become my new signature scent. It's so amazing that I seriously want to order 10 bottles just to keep stored away for when this one finishes. I am in love! :) It's definitely more of a fruity smell but it is sooooo fresh that it's not even a TINY bit overbearing. It is one of those scents that will not give you a headache at all, which in my case is rare because I am very sensitive to scents. I read somewhere that this compared to the smell of Garnier Fructis hair products and I have to say I definitely agree. So great! Another thing worth mentioning is that this bottle on amazon costs about fifty something dollars which MAY seem like a lot, however, in other places it runs for about sixty something. Despite the high cost, you definitely do get a lot of bang for your buck! Please give this a try if you love anything fresh and fruity! :D"
B002Z7FVTQ,Nicole,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2013",Staple Scent,"I was very happy with this transaction as a whole. The price was better than buying this product from the mall (which is what I usually do). Shipping was fast. The product was exactly as I expected. For the past few years, this has been a fragrance that I can't do without. It's a soft, fruity (but mature & sophisticated scent). I will put emphasis on the fact that it does not make you smell like a little girl. D&G did a great job with this one. I've read that this line of fragrances is part of a group that can be worn by men or women. In my opinion, this one is strictly for the ladies. I wear it year-round because it smells that good. In the warmer months, I probably wear this scent 4 if not 5 days of the week. My only criticism would be that this scent does not last the whole day. I will re-apply mid-day. You really can't over do it. Having said that, I still give it 5 stars. For me, it's a must have fragrance."

It reminds me of a childhood memory that I can't quite place my finger on (my mother said the SAME thing when she smelled it - it's a scent that seems to evoke memory in us for some reason!). It's quite sweet, rosy, and fruity, but not in that overwhelming, powdery Viktor/Rolf ""FlowerBomb"" way. It's a very refreshing yet warm scent.

I really DON'T love the packaging, it's a very heavy bottle and I keep fearing I'll drop it because the cap is pull-off, not twist off. I wish they had made a more elegant bottle."

On the way home I smelled something new and realized it was my left arm. I was kind of boggled since I have the same perfume but I never really got that scent on me before. So right when I got home I immediately sprayed the perfume that I bought from here on my right arm. I waited for it to dry down but the two just smell different. Like the one that I have is a little weak compared to the one in ULTA. It's been about 4-5 hours now and the scent on my left arm is still there and smells fruity (watermelon) while the scent on my right arm smells barely anything. I'm honestly really disappointed since I could have just gotten it in ULTA for the same price and better quality. Oh well, lesson learned."

B002TASNMQ,Kris,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2013",Good cologne.,"So, this is my first cologne review and purchase on Amazon. I'm not disappointed; I know a lot of people have received fake frags off Amazon. Lucky me, I got recieved an authentic one. So, before I review the cologne itself here's a few tips to know if yours is an authentic, first; instead of buying from other merchants buy it off Amazon itself instead, that way even if you got a fake, you can get a refund. Second, once you receive the cologne, there should be a code of numbers somewhere on the box and the cologne itself, mine is five numbers above the barcode yours could be different. If the number on the cologne matches with the box, congratulations you have an authentic frag. Third, go to checkcosmetic.net to check the shelf life, enter the code of the bottle or box in and it should tell you when it was manufactured. People usually say the average shelf life of a cologne is 3 years, if it's less than 3 years your cologne is not expired. I hope this helps.

So onto the cologne, my nose doesn't pick off the notes and I haven't ""worn"" it yet but I did a test spray on my arm. It smells great, it starts off as a fresh black oriental smell, keeping that mysterious black masculine feel to it but fresh then after maybe half an hour it changes to a sweet masculine smell, it doesn't overdo it in fact it lures you in; I guess that's where seduction comes in? Sillage depending on the areas you spray it could be average, to almost average. Keep in mind that I only sprayed once on my arm so it might be better on a different area or if you spray on multiple places. Longevity it's very good in that department, the scent lasted 8 hours with one spray on the arm. And even after I took a shower, there was still a very small lingering faint scent on my arm that I tested which the other I didn't spray did not have. All-in-all it's a good buy and I plan to purchase from Amazon again. Now, where would I use this cologne? I would say the ideal place or setting would be on a date, the lure this scent pulls off makes it ideal in a date situation. It's not a loud scent but if anyone gets close enough, they might be lured in by this frag. 4.8/5 due the sillage but since it might be because of one spray to the arm and the lure, I decided to give it a 5/5."
B002TASNMQ,Gary L Forbush,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2023",A pretty good scent.,It seems to last most of the day and I have received a few compliments on it. For the price it's worth trying. It's no Sauvage but it doesn't cost over a hundred dollars a bottle.

The fragance goes away fast, and if you spray to much, you only will smell like alcahol. I used to spray 2 times on each side of the neck and it would last for hours. Something its different, is it a ""fake"", did they change the formula? Or they don't make it anymore, and what they are selling are just very old bottles(it is very cheap, but it wasn't like that) . I really like this cologne, hopefully I just got fake ones. I will try to find out what's going on.

Like its a sexy smell idk it just smell really good! Excellent price I would buy it here again. Shipment was like 6 days! Buy this for your bf, brother, yourself
It smell really really good!"
B002TASNMQ,Zeeshan Siddiqui,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2012",Very mild to put it mildly,"The reason i opted for this cologne in the first place was because i was searching for a replacement for Baryshnikov that got discontinued a few years ago for unexplainable reasons. The notes listed were some what similar to Baryshnikov's so i thought I'll give it a shot. Not only does it not smell like Baryshnikov, it doesn't smell like anything at all. Let me explain.

Don't get me wrong. I don't like strong smelling colognes and am all for subtlety when it comes to mens fragrances. However, i either got duped with a fake bottle or this thing is like water. It has very little to no smell and it evaporates within seconds. I haven't tried a tester at a store so i can't really compare the two but at the end of the day this thing was a waste of money for me."

I also am getting a very strong Almond/Nutmeg note that is not listed as a primary note but deff smells like its in there. I was definitely beyond surprised smelling this fragrance it was nothing that I expected. I expected fresh spicyness from the pink pepper and sweet from the citurs and bergamot but didnt get that at all. I have over 50 different Fragrances and this scent is definitely unique. longevity it not that good, im wearing it 4 hours now and i am struggling to smell it, i have to move around to get a good whiff. application was about 8-10 sprays so i deff put on more than enough. projection isnt that great as well. maybe this Fragrance will perform better in cooler air i will try that. its 85degrees out today. all in all i give this a 5 out of 10. for the 20$ price that it was im not dissatisfied with it ... Now, compared to Antonio Banderas' THE ICON ... that stuff is AMAZING !!! I'd pay $75.00 a bottle for that stuff and its only $3.00 more than The Secret Temptation.. one of the best Fragrances from the House of A.B. I have smelled so far.

So I decided to give it a try, and loved it so much that I grabbed a second bottle for my father as a Christmas present. I bought another bottle for myself a few years later and I still have that one. It serves its purpose very well and it draws a lot of attention, I get asked frequently which parfum it it. It is not overpowering, and it is well balanced and fresh, yet very elegant. Something you could use for every occasion . The price is still great for what I can see. Definitely recommended as a part of any man's collection."

So I thoguht I would try out more of his fragrance line.
Well this one was a bummer. BIG disappointment.
First, the note breakdown says citrus, and it's got pineapple in the picture.
So I thought it would be a ""lighter"" more citrusy version of icon, which is a more spicy fragrance.
Nope. This one smells kind of like an old grandma.
I'm kind of exaggerating but, think of a HEAVY floral scent, that old women tend to overspray on themselves because their sense of smell is poor, so they overspray.
It smells like that. Very heavy floral scent.
Suffice to say this was a disappointment.
Now I don't know if I should bother getting other fragrance from the Banderas line.
Icon was good though."

This is a sensual marine slightly sweet frag! Totally not an Invictus clone! If anything theres a hint of it but far from it! Nice to have in the collection. Not as strong as Id like it to be but when you layer it with lotion it should last longer. All in all, a good buy for 21 bucks but this is nothing super spectacular but worth it!"

It's not nasty, just not my thing, i will however try it for a few days and i'll also layer it on itself to see if any other notes reveal themselves.

B09ND4SFXT,Gabriella,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2023",Very nice!,"I got these for my daughter for her birthday. She turned 11 and is getting into all the girly things. I searched lots of different brands, read tons of reviews and settled on this. I liked the price and the fact she‚Äôd have three different options. I figured there‚Äôd be at least one she liked. It comes in a nice package, and when she opened them and sprayed them, they all smell so good! She loves them! She has her favorite, but she likes them all. Heck, I do too. The sizes are great, you get your moneys worth and then some I think. Perfect for my baby girl, she is so excited to have her own perfume collection starting. I recommend these, I think they are great, nice quality, reasonably priced. She has always had extremely sensitive skin and I was concerned about getting something that would cause a rash/breakout/skin irritation but I am happy to say she‚Äôs had no problems which is a big deal. There are lots of products labeled for sensitive skin that she cannot even use. That is a huge plus! . These are a nice size to have one to keep in your car, purse, etc. and be assured you‚Äôll always smell good when out! Also I just wanted to say, I see many people writing about how the scent doesn‚Äôt last and just wanna add that after a while we cannot smell it on ourselves the way others can. My daughter uses one of these perfumes daily and I can smell her for a good long while, and the smell is on her clothes. So, the longevity of this product is not bad or unreasonable in my opinion. You‚Äôre just not smelling it on yourself anymore!"

B07TR75W9H,Angie,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2023",Greatest ever,Best invention ever!!!! Can‚Äôt reach the middle of my back when my skin is all dry and this spray works great. Does not leave a white mess like the lotions available in spray can
B07TR75W9H,Christine M. Myers,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2023",Excellent,"Sometimes my back gets so dry and applying lotion is hard. This works so wonderfully. I will say it's an ointment spray so be careful. I spray it on and then put on an old T-shirt so the ""ointment"" doesn't stain a good shirt. It absorbs into my skin pretty quickly, though. The old T-shirt is a small price to pay for the itch relief this gives me."

B07TR75W9H,N. F. C..,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2023","Good, but I'd generally recommend the regular tube ointment","It's good. I bought some for early healing of fresh tattoos, to get a nice spread without having to touch more than necessary. The ointment is a lot heavier and thicker and requires more work to spread which can irritate the freshly needled skin but this stuff leaves a little more of a tacky greasy layer that kind of sticks to clothing, for a given lightness ofa pplication, than the ointment. I'd generally just get the tube of ointment instead"
B07TR75W9H,Hannah,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2023",Tattoo use,I use this for my tattoos (after they‚Äôve healed) to help keep them moisturized.

I used Aquaphor on my skin and was pleasantly surprised at how quickly my dry skin disappeared. It is a little cold when you spray it directly on your skin but I spray in on my hand to warm it up a bit and it works perfectly! I keep one spay at work and one at home.
B07TR75W9H,Linda Chalk,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2023",Non-greasy and effective spray for hard to reach skin areas,"My dermatologist recommended this when I told her I couldn't reach areas on my back to apply a lotion for skin damage. She gave me some of the Aquaphor spray and !'m using it all over now, not just my back. It goes on evenly without being oily or making a mess on my clothes. It dries quickly too without any scent.

B07TR75W9H,GKK,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2022",It works! Easy to use!,"I've had eczema and dry skin all my life, but fortunately I've been able to control it mostly with moisturizers. However, as I've gotten older, heavier, and stiffer, it has become difficult to reach parts of my body. I've tried long handled sponges for regular moisturizer (hard to rub in well, leaves residue), even spray suntan lotion (concerns re: chemicals, I'm a cancer survivor), etc. Once I discovered this, I was excited! It works well, I use it on my back and legs (especially the backs) and it works well! I always make sure I have a bathroom rug under me when I do my legs so I don't get a slippery floor. I mostly use it at night and let it dry before I put on my night gown so it doesn't get on my clothes. Actually no staining on the night gowns, so it would probably be ok on regular clothes too. It's a good moisturizer and easy to use. For my back I just lean forward, spray the back from over my shoulders and let it settle. It's a little pricey but worth every penny to me."

B07TR75W9H,Tbonita,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2019",Spray greasy goodness!,"My body skin is so. dry. Year round. No matter what season. My fake tan I‚Äôm partial to makes it more dry! I‚Äôd read on a webpage about fake tan tips a spray lotion is great because it doesn‚Äôt create a lot of tan-fading friction and they reach alllll over (my back gets particularly dry!). I can reach my own back from years of fake tanning but I try to avoid the contortion needed if and whenever possible. This was the first spray lotion I received (popular competitor in a green spray bottle is coming my way too). Well I‚Äôm familiar with and partial to very heavy oils and lotions and this delivered BIG TIME! It isn‚Äôt AS heavy as the aquafor ointment of course, but for a 360 continuous aerosol spray this is very very emollient AND occlusive, meaning it hydrates super well and seals that moisture in! I love how it has lanolin, my favorite occlusive! I even use lanolin nursing moms‚Äô cream on my lips and my lips haven‚Äôt been dry in the 5 years I‚Äôve used it, not once! And I wear matte lips a lot. Anyway I‚Äôd never guess that an aerosol could be so greasy (for me that‚Äôs a compliment of the highest sort). I‚Äôm imagining the ‚Äúother‚Äù brand of spray lotion won‚Äôt be so thick. This stuff has saved my dry skin! You still gotta rub it in, but it spreads superrrr easily."

However, with mobility issues, it was difficult for me to apply it myself. The spray completely eliminates that challenge and makes it much easier for me to stay compliant with my doctor's orders. The product is first class and has eliminated dryness, pain and flaking. I wouldn't start or end my day without it. It's best applied immediately following a bath / shower."

As I've gotten older, every winter, my back will itch constantly. This year has been particularly bad. My mom received a sample of this and gave it to me. I didn't hold out a lot of hope that it would provide any kind of lasting relief, but I tried it. From the first spray, the itching subsided quickly, and I only use it every other day now. As soon as I step out of the shower and dry off, I step back in and give my back a quick, light spray, and that's all it takes. How easy is that? I use so little that the shower floor doesn't get slick or coated. And a little amount is all it takes! It does leave a light coating on your skin, but it is so thin, that it won't stain your clothing. I am now itch-free 99% of the time, and I hope they never stop making this product!"
B07TR75W9H,Johnni,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2022","Works amazing, I hate the feel of it.",It works great I can't stand the feeling of any lotion which is why I bought this spray on stuff but it's very greasy but works amazing
B07TR75W9H,Delia W.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2023",Amazing product,I have Dry-eye along with a others of allergies. I had a difficult time finding moisturizer that is light as well as effective. This product can be sprayed directly into the eyelids much like Vaseline. This product is however much lighter and has a healing element.

B07TR75W9H,me,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2022",Wonderful product,"I have always loved the Aquaphor product, especially for things like healing cuts. When I saw this product listed, I had to try it. As I've gotten older, my skin has been showing it. I've been trying quite a few body moisturizers with a greater or lesser degree of success. Nothing that lasted very long. This product sprays on so light but I noticed a difference in my skin immediately and it kept my skin feeling wonderful for a long time. It's so easy, you don't even have to use your hands to rub it in. Just spray a mist and it covers the area evenly. Highly recommend."

B07TR75W9H,EH,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2023",It‚Äôs too hard to use and makes any floors impossibly slippery,"The formula is ok in a pinch. It‚Äôs not as hydrating or occlusive as regular aquaphor. the biggest issue is it‚Äôs impossible to find a place to stand to spray this. If you‚Äôre in the bathtub or a tile floor, it gets so slippery you literally can‚Äôt even tip toe over it, and it takes an alcohol based cleaner to clean it. If you spray it over carpet, you‚Äôre coating it with aquaphor too- yuck. The only real options is to stand on many towels I suppose."
B07TR75W9H,Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2023",Quite sticky on the skin,"Decently moisturizing, but made my skin feel so sticky and greasy for over a day afterward.

B07TR75W9H,AllieN,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2022",Different but sufficient,"I was influenced to purchase this from TikTok. It‚Äôs ok, but I feel like you have to put a lot on in order to feel completely moisturized and therefore you go through the lotion quickly. It was fun to try but I most likely will not be purchasing again and will stick to the pump lotion"
B07TR75W9H,PK Larkin,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2021","We love aquaphor, but this was not as great as we hoped it to be",We have eczema in our house and have aquaphor present at all times. Thought I would try this out to see if it was easier and it disappoints. Still great product in the container but the extra cost for spraying was unimpressive. Stick to the original. Only got 4 stars because its still aquaphor and good product but it comes out foamy and cold and you still have to rub it in.
B07TR75W9H,GeminiWolf,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2020",Quick and easy application!,"I bought this after my tattoo artist informed me that there was a spray version of Aquaphor. I have been using it twice daily for about a week now with my new tattoo, and it is so much faster and easier than rubbing in the regular stuff! It's easy to use on a large area, like the side of my calf. It goes on kind of wet at first, then it thickens a little like the normal consistency of Aquaphor. The only downside is you have to be careful where you spray it- it gets all over the floor (making anything non-carpet slippery!). I tried doing it over the tub thinking the excess fumes weren't enough to really hit the tub, but boy that made the tub like an ice skating rink. I just put a towel on the floor to catch any excess spray now.

Overall great for spray and go on new tattoos!"

B07TR75W9H,Sarah R.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2021",LIVESAVER for this single gal,"I suffer from dry skin year-round, but the wintertime is especially brutal. Given that I'm single and not especially flexible, this has meant that my back is an itchy, rashy mess from November to March. This stuff is a LIFESAVER. Though the instructions say to rub the product in after spraying, it's really not necessary. I use this all over my body after showering and love how soft and moisturized it makes my skin feel without feeling heavy or greasy. I also love how little of it I need to use in comparison to traditional rub-on moisturizers. This relieved my itchiness after a single use and improved redness and bumps after two days. SO impressed with this product."

You know those places that going over the shoulders doesn't work, or reaching up from under your arms?? Those irritating places that nothing but a spaghetti server with fingers could scratch??
Well this winter my skin decided to be super dry and itchy, but now it's not.
I bend over slightly and spray away that dry skin after my showers, and then just put on jammies or a tshirt and let it soak in.
I spray my legs as well, it takes a lot of the pain away from my shoulders to be able to just spray it on.
WARNING
put down an old towel or something to collect the overspray it's pretty slippery!!!!!
I hope you'll try it, Oh and there is no scent."
B07TR75W9H,Sara Gmitro,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2021",A bit much...,"I got this after having a can of Vaseline lotion spray for a long time that I use solely for my back. I tried this as a replacement, but I found this to be pretty oily for a spray lotion - I'm sure it's great for super dry skin, but it was just too heavy for me and took quite a while to be absorbed."
B07TR75W9H,Bekah,"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2021",brilliant invention,"I have the softest skin ever because of this stuff. I am a big fan of aquaphor in almost any form in comes in. Ive been using it as a hand/foot cream because of all of the handwashing i do. When I found out this was a spray version i was very excited. I go through this quickly, however, its worth it to have moisturized skin. I put this on right after the shower before bed. This can feel thick/greasy....it is aquaphor after all! i wish the price point was slightly lower... but it wont stop me from repurchasing."

B07TR75W9H,Cheryl Sanders,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2020",Not as good as the jar!,This is a little lighter that the Aquaphor in a jar or tube. I was expecting even lighter. The number one ingredient in this spray is BUTANE. I know butane evaporates but it leaves a slight lingering scent. This is also a little greasier feeling than the jar. I like it but not as well as the jar.

My husband‚Äôs skin condition really requires more of an ointment type product than a lotion or cream. Seven years of trying dozens of different products, and then I discovered Aquaphor Ointment Body Spray. It couldn‚Äôt be easer to use and somehow the nozzle never clogs.

B07TR75W9H,SCM,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2020",Cool idea but not practical,"I had high hopes after reading the reviews but I‚Äôm not liking the product as much. Like many have said, you have to cover the floor or else someone can seriously injure themselves by slipping. It also doesn‚Äôt spray evenly. The liquid is so thick it cakes up the nozzle and makes a mess. You have to have room to spray because it‚Äôs like petroleum and you may spray it on other things‚Äîyes, silly me for trying to rush and use this product before work. I spent more time cleaning up after the spray and it is supposed to make things easier. I rather take the time and lotion with my hands because you end up rubbing it in anyway. More importantly, it‚Äôs super cold! After taking a hot shower, the last thing I want to do is blast cold spray on my body! This product was a cool idea for a hot second. Over it."
B07TR75W9H,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2020","Easy to use, cool concept, overall good moisturizer","The spray nozzle on this is super easy to use. It's not completely greasy hands free since you have to somewhat rub in the product and rub off excess from the can itself. Wasn't completely thrilled with the price but if you're suffering from dry skin and hate the idea of lathering lotions/creams on, this is for you.

B07TR75W9H,GDB,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2021",BE CAREFUL WHEN USING - SLIPPERY & COULD BE DANGEROUS,"I gave this a one star rating, but a 5 star for moisturizing, a 5 star for value and a 4 star for being lightweight. So why the two star rating overall? Because this product can be potentially dangerous to use. How? You take out your can, you have just finished showering and you decide that the best place to spray will be in the shower, so as not to get the spray all over the bathroom floor. You spray and rub in and then commence to leaving the shower. And what happens? The shower floor is so slippery from the oil, that you practically break your neck. No matter WHERE you spray it inside, you set yourself up for the same danger. I even tried putting down a towel on the floor, but oil still sprayed further than I thought, especially when I was doing my legs, and then the TOWEL started slipping. So unless I am spraying outside on grass, which I likely would never, I will not be using this again. And heaven forbid that someone not familiar with it's oiliness, like a kid, uses it in the shower, thinking that it's a cool way to get moisturized. A disaster waiting to happen! There should be disclaimer on the can, as everyone doesn't think these things through: FOR USE ONLY ON AN ABSORBENT SURFACE THAT CANNOT SLIP"
B07TR75W9H,L,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2022",I love this!,"Aquaphor in a spray! What‚Äôs not to like? You can apply without getting your hands greasy, it‚Äôs great.

You can feel it on the floor where you spray no matter how careful you are. The moisture is also very sticky and after using it for a week, I had some itchy bumps on my back. Also, I ordered two same sized canisters but received a big one and a little one (it isn‚Äôt returnable so Amazon refunded me for the cost of one).
