B08H8S61FY,Jordan Mays,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2022",Beautiful Inspiration of MFK Oud Satin Mood,"This is an absolutely beautiful scent. After watching many reviews on YouTube about Ministry of Oud I finally decided to pull the trigger on Oud Satin. Oud Satin is a fragrance dupe for the popular Maison Francis Kurkdjian Oud Satin Mood Fragrance.

This from beginning to the dry down is absolutely beautiful and extremely similar to the original it‚Äôs inspired by. You will not regret this purchase. Great performance, beautiful scent, and a beautiful bottle for your perfume/cologne stand.

This is also an extrait de Parfum which means it has more oil concentration.

Thank me later!"
B08H8S61FY,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2023","The perfume is great, shipping not so great.",I was suprised when I was notified the item is being shipped by UPS instead of Amazon. That means I missed my parcel 3 times and I had to adjust my schedule so I didn't miss it the forth time. I wouldn't purchase this item again for this reason. The perfume is great.
B08H8S61FY,nonny,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2023",WORTH IT,This smells more like Jo Malone Velvet Rose and OUD than it does MFK. The projection isn‚Äôt quite there but a good scent to have in your collection to layer with something else.

B01ELWU4NU,Raf Hakin,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2023",Great for the right buyer,"First I want to be clear on why I'm giving it 4 stars, this scent is just not for me. Im new to fragrances and still young, but I saw some awesome reviews on this so I made the purchase.

The scent itself is very nice, and great quality. Im not great at being able to tell ""nodes"" apart or identify certain smells, but with this one I smell honey, and tobacco, very strongly. I would say this is an old mans fragrance.

Im prefer colognes like YSL L'homme and Versache Eros, because they semll clean, fresh, and young. I feel like 18.21 smells too old man like and not really my style at this point in life.

That said, if you are an older guy and looking for this kind of scent, this one's probably the best quality on the market. Even though its not my style, I can recognize that it smells very good and performs well."
B01ELWU4NU,matt durkin,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2023",Another Home Run For This Brand,"Love this product ! Great sent that last all day, I will buy again!
Just need the deodorant to complete the bathroom takeover"
B01ELWU4NU,Kaden Verhasselt,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2022",Very sweet yet masculine,"As a tobacco cologne I did wish to smell a lot more. The honey scent at the very beginning of its life is extremely strong! I like the dry down a lot more than the very beginning. I have used Villain from Pete and Pedro and that is more of what I was expecting. Don‚Äôt get me wrong this cologne is amazing! It is not intimidating but give you more of an approachable scent. The villain label from Pete and Pedro has a very Aromac scent that gives off a kick in the face of high quality cigar tobacco throughout the entire life of the cologne. The notes of vanilla in it are immaculate. This has more of a pipe tobacco scent with a strong aroma of honey at the beginning but fades into a nice smooth scent.

Now this would be an every day wear for me if it wasn‚Äôt so expensive. Villan is only a $50 bottle and the scent is more of a fancy event for me but once again since it is so cheap I wear it a lot! This sweet tobacco spirits would be my daily wearer if it wasn‚Äôt a 80-90$$ bottle. Although the opening comes out as a very strong honey aroma. The drydown gives you a very smooth smell of tobacco and I am okay with that. The only recommendation I could make on this cologne would to be reduce the honey and add in some vanilla notes. Other than that, it is a great cologne! Do not be afraid to try it out!"
B01ELWU4NU,Abdulaziz Fitaihi,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023","Nice, but‚Ä¶..Don‚Äôt spray a lot of it or ‚Ä¶.","Not bad if you sprayed a little bit of it, but at the same time, it doesn‚Äôt last for long time and will smell different if you resprayed it after some time on your skin. So basically I can‚Äôt rely on it all the time"
B01ELWU4NU,Big T-Bone,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2023",Love the scent and its long lasting,"I like wearing this when I go out for a night on the town..... Its label says ""Sweet Tobacco"" but its more like a tobacco with strong notes of HONEY...... I will buy this again, its a little pricy but I feel its worth it. The scent does last a long time however.... I still like to carry an atomizer in my pocket and add more while in rest room. Their Body wash (sold in a plastic liquor bottle) has the same scent however their beard balm does not...."
B01ELWU4NU,Optimus Maximus Primus,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2016",Great Quality & The def. Of A Masculine Cologne.,"This scent was Heavy on the Honey and in my opinion for a much older gentleman but thats a little subjective.
However , what is absolute is that this is one of the finest quality fragrances I have ever had the chance to get my nose on.

Just because I feel it doesn't fit my personality or age doesn't mean this isn't a top shelf scent.

I can tell that it was crafted with care like a well tailored suit. It had the right amount of tobacco but for me it was hidden under the honey note which lasted a long time on my skin . Now because of the honey I can see how some women could try to pull this off as a unisex especially if they are outspoken and bold personality type yet, I think this is more of a man scent and I would not recommend for a woman.

It is not a sweet scent like Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille and it is not as harsh like a Havana by Thierry Mugler Havane.

It reminded me of Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanille just not as sweet and this has a dry tabaco scent to it. It also reminds me a little of L'Instant de Guerlain pour Homme Just add tobacco but It is, its on master piece ,the very def. of a masculine cologne ,and I was very impressed I just don't think it was for me but who knows I may give it another try sometime down the line.

If you like these fragrances you will love this.

B01ELWU4NU,Jordan,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",Great smell,Out of the three colognes 1821 makes this one last the longest and is the strongest smell.
B01ELWU4NU,James Braley,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2023",You wont be disapointed,Its a tad harsh on the initial application. After a few minutes you get used to it and your body interacts with the fragrance and it becomes a very appealing cologne. Its the only reason I dont give it an overall 5. But definitely worth the money.
B01ELWU4NU,Tatish 4K,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2022",i'd like to change my review due to intense impression!,"when i received this item and used it for the first time i was not feeling quite good about it and made a quick bad review. after a while i was not going to change it but it was so intense impression i started to like it so much that im gonna change 2 starts to 5 stars. scent is quite strong even when i open the cap of perfume smell spread in the entire room. it amazed me so much , it is even better than many expensive perfumes out there . smell is so strong and pleasant that im gonna buy it again. bottle itself is promising and masculine. i love it very much"
B01ELWU4NU,Weston,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2023",Hands down best scent!,"I absolutely love this scent! I have used their body wash previously, and immediately fell in love. The scent is strong but not overpowering with this cologne, and I have been wearing it all day and can still smell it. New go to cologne going forward!"
B01ELWU4NU,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2017",Perfection on all nines!,"If I could give more than 5 stars I would. I'm more then pleased with this product, but more so pleased with the customer service. Had an issue and they promptly took care of my issue. Their customer service is something other companies should take a look at. They listen to feedback and stand behind their products. What more could you ask for?! As for this product, it lasts ALL day on me! After showering, my wife tells me that she can still smell it or asks if I just put on some cologne. This is coming from someone who is not yet in their 30's, but considers themselves a connoisseur when it comes to things like this. This juice here, is pure quality. And made here in the USA. Not many are nowadays. None that I can think of. As for the scent, I get a good dose of honey upfront and throughout the scent. Nothing too sweet, but just right. This seems to be sitting along with the whiskey note, which I really don't like in fragrances because usually it is too strong, smells of a old man, or just ruins it for me. This, is perfection to me. Everything seems to be in perfect moderation to where it is not too much of anything, but just enough of what is needed. And believe me, a little goes a long way! And now with this being sold directly from the distributor, you don't have to concern yourself with wondering if it's a new batch or an old one. Or if it was properly stored. The bottles have also been revamped for those who may have faced issues with it before. So in conclusion, get it while you can. Good things come and go in life so make sure you take your opportunity when it presents itself!

Thanks!"
B01ELWU4NU,Richard S,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2017","It is awesome, I kept reading the reviews on YouTube and ...","Guys, You nailed it on this Cologne, It is awesome, I kept reading the reviews on YouTube and finally decided I had to hurry up and get a bottle of this for myself, the anticipation waiting for this to arrive was so exciting, just like Christmas all over again, was a bit nervous when it arrived as I know you had a little problem with some leakage in some bottles but I know the response from you was that you had the problem fixed and I was happy to see it is and my bottle was exactly what I was hoping for, the box it came in is definitely a masterpiece and the bottle itself is the same, I am wearing this right now and have had several compliments in the short time I have had it, I carry the bottle in one of the inside coat pockets when I go out so if someone compliments me on it I take it out and show them the bottle and let them try it and at least 3 of my friends just last week said they are getting an order out right away for this awesome mens cologne, I am new to the Cologne collecting hobby and have probably 23 different colognes and this as of now is my top choice, and I have Bleu De Channel-Dolce @ Gabbana the One-TerreD'Hermes and many more that are rated very high by many people but in my opinion 18.21 Man Made Sweet Tobacco Spirits is on the top of my list. Thank You very much for the work all of you put into this beautiful product, you have a lifetime Customer. Richard Sanvick"
B01ELWU4NU,Curtis,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2022",Love the smell,I was introduced to 18.21 cologne by BirchBox a couple years ago. While the scent ‚ÄúSweet Tobacco‚Äù sounds odd it is my favorite smelling cologne so far and smells unique when compared to others. I mostly get compliments on it while occasionally get told that it comes off very musky. My only minor complaint is that I wish it lasted longer but I feel like this is a problem with almost all colognes in my experience. I use this in combination with their body lotion to keep the scent lasting longer. Really like it.
B01ELWU4NU,Arlo,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2017",... I'm going to compare it to three of my favorite colognes currently,"I just received this product and I'm going to compare it to three of my favorite colognes currently.

A) Cigar (Remy Latour)
B) By The Fireplace (Replica)
C) Jazz Club (Replica)

A) Hands down for me, Cigar is incredible. It's masculine, sexy, and very timeless. It's got a tobacco scent to it but in a way that's not obvious. You can wear this during any season but best when it's cooler.

B) By The Fireplace is the most gorgeous smoky sweet scent I've ever come across. It puts Tom Ford Oud, Mugler Havane, etc to shame (they smell absolutely horrendous IMO). It's pricey at $126 for a bottle but well worth it if you want something truly smells smokey and sweet. DEFINITELY a colder weather scent.

C) Jazz Club is an incredible scent that reminds you of leather, Manhattans, and a touch of cigars. Great silage - definitely a winter scent.

So I sprayed 18.21 on me and took note of what I smelled as the time passed by. Initially it's incredibly sweet...overpowering scents of honey and vanilla. As time passed, it turned into a more cigar leaf scent but one that's been dipped in honey or something sweet. It doesn't have earthy tones like Cigar does. As even more time passes by, the scent becomes very tobacco-ish.

Definitely a nice scent but the sweetness still remains and is somewhat overpowering for me. Not what I expected. If the sweetness was toned down a bit...maybe by a half, this would be an excellent scent because it has so many layers as time passes by.

For now I'm not a real fan. But I'll try it a couple of times to see. If it doesn't work out, it's a gift."
B01ELWU4NU,Maher Awad,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2023",Lots of compliments,I get lots of compliments on this cologne
B01ELWU4NU,Ty Fedderman,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2023",Definitely Buy Again,Wife loves it. Gotten numerous compliments from others as well! Just smells like a classy man should smell.
B01ELWU4NU,Robert A.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2022","WATCH OUT FOR ""AUTO RE-ORDER""","Colognes will last for years. Just a mist and you have more than you need.

But BINGO, Somehow I got another bottle sent this week. Amazon is processing a credit for me, but not sure if they have taken steps to stop this auto reorder at 5 months as I now see on original order."
B01ELWU4NU,The 4th letter,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2022",Just Wow!!,"I‚Äôm very, very picky when it comes to the fragrances I buy. I don‚Äôt buy cheap I buy quality and though this is cheaper than I would usually spend it‚Äôs worth as much as it he high dollar fragrances have bought.. this is comparable to Tom Ford‚Äôs Tobacco Vanille scent (which is much much more expensive) I would not put it on par with Tom Ford but this is very close.

B01ELWU4NU,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2023",A little goes a long way,Very strong scent one spray will do the job. I do like the smell of this product and will likely buy it again.
B01ELWU4NU,RJ in Cali,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2017",Nothing like sweet tobacco and booze,"I had only smelled this fragrance as the combination of scents in my grandfather's old-school barber shop. So this was a blind buy for me. It took me back to the old bald barber lathering my grandfather's face and shaving it with the straight razor, which he sharpened on a long leather strap hanging from the side of the barber chair. There is the man smoking a pipe outside the door of the shop. The smell of the shaving cream, the leather strap, the pipe smoke, the talcum powder he would apply with a large brush and the bay rum aftershave...all of that is in this bottle. There is the tobacco, also the bare essence of vanilla or tonka bean under it all. Sweet Tobacco Spirits is a grown up fragrance for men who remember a simpler time. It transports me back there. This scent is distinctive and boozy. I can't smell it after an hour but anyone within 5 feet still can for at least another 4 hours. Love it."
B01ELWU4NU,Jason,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2019",A Gentlemanly Boozy Vanilla Fragrance,"The Scent: I really don‚Äôt get any tobacco here at all. It‚Äôs just a boozy vanilla (probably bourbon vanilla) run amuck. If there was an actual tobacco note this would be one of the greatest frags of all time. Seriously, it would have given D&G‚Äôs The One a run for it‚Äôs money especially since performance is so good. But alas, it falls in the ‚Äòreally good but not great‚Äô category for me.

Performance: The longevity on this is above average and so is projection so go easy on the trigger. Definitely a cool weather scent that leans nighttime but I think you could pull this off in daytime as well, especially on the coldest days of winter.

Presentation: Nothing but love here. The bottle and cap are dead sexy and the atomizer is outstanding. Honestly the atomizer is nearly as good as a Dior atomizer, yeah, that kind of outstanding."
B01ELWU4NU,Doc,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2022",Wife loves the scent!!,"The scent is fantastic, it last a long time and correspondingly it's worth every dime! It goes very well with the mens body wash of the same name. Two thumbs all the way up!!!"
B01ELWU4NU,Technology Instructor,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2021",It is not bad.,"I like 18.21 products. This is a good size bottle for the price. It is kind of a weak effeminate smell compared to their other more manly scented stuff. I get zero compliments at home or at work when I wear it. That is neither bad nor good. When I wear Fahrenheit by Christian Dior, heads turn, but you don't always want to do that as it would lose its effect, or you at least want to mix it up some. This is not a mix it up or a head turn. It smells like you spilled honey on yourself, and is flowery. Not the vanilla, rum, tobacco type scent from 18.21's other products."
B01ELWU4NU,Tony Kim,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2018",Don't be turned off by the sweet smell and don't be afraid to blindly purchase this like I did. :),"Normally one shouldn't blindly buy cologne/perfume, but I took a gamble, seeing as it was recommended and most of the reviews were very favorable. Unlike some other reviewers, my package fortunately did not leak during shipment and I was very surprised as how much fluid was in the bottle. The stock picture truly doesn't do justice as to how big the package is. Anyways, onto the review. It has a very sweet smell like honey but don't be alarmed. The saccharine smell mellows out greatly over the course of the day and has a faint blend of tobacco and honey. I haven't had the chance of others noticing the smell and commenting on it directly, but I did notice some people making extra passes at me when I talked to them. I don't expect to pick up girls or anything like that with using this, but I really do like how the cologne and the intoxicating smell is making me a bit more self-confident in myself. Maybe I'll report an update in a couple months to see how using this affects my daily life."
B01ELWU4NU,Mom of 4,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2017",Expensive smell for thrifty price,"I bought this for my husband as a less-expensive substitute for Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille, which he loves. He likes this just as much, although it is not quite exactly the same scent. It is similar, but with a little bit of a leathery smell added in. At first it smells very spicy and leathery (like a cross between Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille and Spicebomb by Victor &Rolf), but as it wears on and the top notes fade, it turns into a sweeter, rich vanilla scent similar to Calvin Kline's Obsession for men, but not as pungent and musky. It is not something you smell everyday, and my husband prefers a sofisticated, mature, masculine scent like this one. But most importantly....I am a woman and I like it too. It smells great on him. I read reviews that complained about the packaging/bottle/spray pump...our arrived in perfect condition, no leaks, no problems. Great product/ good value"
B01ELWU4NU,Bultaco,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2023",Manly smell and not too strong,Amazing scent. Sweet tobacco flavor is rich and authentic
B01ELWU4NU,Andy MacKellar,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2022",Doesn‚Äôt smell like shampoo,"I rarely write reviews, but I‚Äôm hoping to make the next person think twice about blindly spending $80 on something that sells more like baby powder than the 18.21 shampoo. The shampoo smells amazing. However the cologne is not a match. It has similar notes, but clearly there‚Äôs additional scents added in, which I found to be overwhelming. The overall aroma isn‚Äôt bad, but it‚Äôs strong and to me smells like something an older lady would wear. The scent wears off quickly than my other colognes. Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt able to return this. The good news, at least it didn‚Äôt leak in the box."
B01ELWU4NU,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023",My New favorite,"Good smelling stuff.....mild, masculine, sweet aroma"
B01ELWU4NU,Mike Carr,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2019",Amazing,"I've owned this for about a year now. Worn it a lot. Smells like sweet honey/vanilla pipe tobacco. It's not complicated but still feels sophisticated. This is a performance monster. You will smell this on you in the morning. It is great but not offensive projection. If you like ""Back to Black"" by Killian (some say ""Light My Fire"" by Killian but I do not think they are as similar), this runs in the same circles. It is not a clone, and it isn't nearly as complex, but that lack of complexity is really this fragrances identity.

As soon as the leaves start turning it is time to wear this. Its a warm sensual scent that not a lot of people are wearing. If you are a mad-person you can wear it when its warm outside, but I wouldn't. Price has already increased from when I bought my first two bottles."
B01ELWU4NU,Fred,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2022",Very unique!,"Tired of fancy and expensive cologne. But this one is just so unique. Once you start using it, you‚Äôll never use other cologne. This tops them all. I even use it when I‚Äôm home that‚Äôs how good it is. I‚Äôll never buy other cologne. I like it!"
B01ELWU4NU,AvidConsumer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2022",It's just too sweet,"I don't know why 99% of ""tobacco"" colognes have too much vanilla and cinnamon in them... its way sweeter smelling than the shampoo - which I love.

I picked this up because I love the scent of the shampoo... but this comes off as either too vanilla-ish or too cinnamon spiced. I've had people say I smell ""clean"" and some say that it reminds them of Cinnabar perfume. Not a single person thought it smelled like tobacco or particularly manly.

Maybe it's just my body chemistry, but if you're looking for a tobacco scent, this ain't it.

Overall super disappointed with this for the price to expectations."
B01ELWU4NU,Jennifer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2017",A must have,"The price is high for a reason. It had a smell that is very difficult to find anywhere else. It you went to be the memorable guy who smells great this is the one. I've had women who are complete strangers compliment on the smell of this cologne. Be very careful to not over due it though. I spray it directly on my chest and neck when I get out of the shower just after drying off (yes, that's the secret). Get this cologne in your pores when they're open, that way if you start to perspire it opens your pores and you smell amazing! Two sprays goes a long way gentleman. BTW, the hair paste works awesome and smells the same too. My advice is to apply that when your hair is still just a smidgen wet, run it in good and style and it'll be good to go.

B01ELWU4NU,James Ellsworth,"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2016",Quality Formulation For Men Who Appreciate Fragrances,"The difference to me in 'LOVING' and 'LIKING' a product like this is the lasting value of the fragrance on my skin and its lasting balance of base and fragrances in the bottle. At $80. plus tax and shipping this is probably not an impulse purchase. I own and use other high end, fragrance-enhanced toiletries (and they don't reach this price level) but this one does seem to be worth the price. The 'tobacco leaf' scent lasts a full 24 hours-plus (I wasn't sweating during this test), the product doesn't sting the skin of a normally sensitive (or 'insensitive?') person; and the description of 'sweet' paired with 'tobacco' is 'spot-on.' The 'sweet' notes here remind me of a sugary rum. They fade as the product dries on the skin. My advice: put it on about a half-hour before you aim to impress anyone and things come into a finely appreciated balance."

B01ELWU4NU,Bradicus,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2016","Great fragrance, poor packaging","My rating for the fragrance would be undoubtedly 5 stars.

Manufacturing and quality control 2 stars.

Fragrance is absolutely amazing. Smells like a cross between Killian Back to Black and Tobacco Vanille. Amazing value for money. Very natural, high quality and garners compliments.

First bottle was received with a loose cap and 25% of the juice missing and soaked into packaging. Amazon quickly sent me a replacement bottle and this one was even worse. The sprayer was crooked, a little over half the juice leaked out on arrival. Both boxes were in good shape so leads me to think it may be a manufacturer/quality control issue.

Between the two faulty bottles I've got a little over 100ml, which is enough to last me a while because this stuff performs well. Unfortunately I have to very carefully store upright and can't travel with it. Even a little tip of the bottle leads to a hand/floor full of fragrance. The bathroom smells of this so I think it may be evaporating out of the bottle.

The fragrance is amazing, just wish the bottle was more durable to better facilitate storage, use and travel."

This seems to have pretty good staying power as I have had people ask what I am wearing later in the day 8-10 hours after application.

I decided to dive in for this fragrance that began its life as a $30 fragrance. And shot up to $80 after the demands skyrocketted.
While others might tell you about its boozy quality and all that, it just did not work for me. It was too dense and you drown in it. It was strictly ok.
It does not receive great compliments like Designer/niche fragrances I've worn in similar settings..
Yes it is different but the boozy note makes you a little nauseous. it suppresses/subdues the other notes for me.

Is it just me who feels that way? no... hit reddit and you will find several others trying to get rid of their bottles with the same opinion.

It is a powerful tobacco bourbon scent. You can begin to pick up the best notes about 30min after your sniffer recovers from just 1 spray to chest area.

B01ELWU4NU,Sharon Heidecker,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2016",A must own cologne!,"Omg, do we love this cologne! I bought my husband first the body wash, and we both love it! I try not to use it, as it's his, but he washes me with it when we get the chance to shower together! Such a warm sexy smell, but it's also very luxurious and sudsy! We'd both recommend using it. I ordered the cologne for him for Christmas, and we both also love it, although I don't wear it. We recommend to everyone. Don't hesitate, buy them both and surprise your man!"
B01ELWU4NU,Robert,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2019",So far so good,"Got it, tried it, liked it. Nice cologne, smells good, doesn't last all that long though. Its not overpowering but not real subtle either when it first goes on. Overall a nice fragrance."
B01ELWU4NU,TDP,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2020",Great Product,Scent is just as expected. I purchased the pomade as well so I knew the cologne would be just as good. No complaints . The shipment arrived a day later but honestly after thinking about it? with the weather event we had the last 24 hours it wasn‚Äôt the carriers fault. Great product... great service... Would continue to order
B01ELWU4NU,Doug,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2021",Love the scent,There is something about this scent that is different than all my other colognes. Very unique and have received compliments on the way I smell.
B01ELWU4NU,Rw,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2019",Shop for lesser price.,"I would have given five stars but the price took a star away.

Great fragrance, long lasting, not overpowering.

I hope I can find the same amount at a lesser price, because I would love to have more."
B01ELWU4NU,C. Davis,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2016",Excellent!!,"Without question a true surprise!! Between the combination of tobacco, honey and a variety of other ingredients this most certainly turns heads. In and of itself it flanks Tom Ford - Tobacco Vanille quite easily. Two sprays will suffice for most. Overall, that alone raises this fragrances' worthiness more than anticipated. 18.21 is a new fragrance that many will find to be one of the best to wear. Again, it will turn heads and draw subtle attention to, absolutely!!
Scent - 9/10, Sillage - 8/10, Longevity - 9/10"

B01ELWU4NU,Ilyass oudghiri,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2022",VERY Disappointing!,"I got this cologne for a third time based on my subscription. I was so very upset that not only is the longevity already pretty bad, but this time, the cologne simply came with no good scent. It smelled so bad that it felt like alcohol and gasoline combined. This is very disappointing because I remember the first time I got this cologne. I was so in love with it that I told everyone about how nice the cologne smelled. But not this time. I am canceling my subscription and hopefully, those who read this review won't get fooled or tricked like me."

Amazon. I have been using Perry Ellis 360 for over 20 years. I have to say that it smells the same but it‚Äôs water downed. Meaning it‚Äôs less cologne and more water. I spray it on my neck and ears and it may last than 30 mins if that. Disappointed!!! Do your research and spray a little to see if it last through out the day.

B000P25170,Dominic T. Sedillo,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2021",Worth this cost in smell...,"I've been using this cologne for years. Cologne is very personal and I think it always depends on the taste of the user.

It lasts the entire work day for me. I use it sparingly so I just need it to be apparent when people are close.

For what I paid and the sizes of the bottle I think it is well worth the cost. It will last me for a year or more at least.

This has a potent smell with just a few sprays but it's not overwhelming. It's appealing and masculine.

I HIGHLY recommend."

B002G789QC,Mrs. Chadwick,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on November 24, 2016",,"Many years ago I can remember my late grandmother and my Mum using this, but I could never remember what it was called, but could always remember the still and design of the label.

So when I was looking for a fragrance for a gift the other day, guess what I found out the fragrance I loved as a child was called ‚Äú4711 Original Eau de Cologne Splash‚Äù, so I was really please and decided to treat myself.

It arrived well packed from Amazon, so the bottle was still in one piece. :-)

They still use the same lovely branded boxes that I remember from childhood.

The cologne is in a glass bottle with the branded label on the front. The firm still uses a metal top which is in gold and red and has a red branded label round the lid, (the top was very tight so it took a little time to open it) and the 4711 is on top of the lid.

4711 is a traditional German Eau de Cologne by Maurer & Wirtz which has been around for 222 years, the firm has a large range that also includes deodorant, aftershave and soap. :-)

It uses essential oils and has an aromatheraputic effect.

The top notes are orange oil, peach, basil, bergamot and lemon. Its middle notes are cyclamen, lily, melon, jasmine and bulgarian rose. The base notes are patchouli, tahitian vetiver, musk, sandalwood, oakmoss and cedar.

It‚Äôs a classic and can be used by both women and men.

I can remember as a child when I didn‚Äôt feel well or had trouble sleeping it was always something my late grandmother and Mum used to place on my temples to help relax me.

I still find this relaxing and calming today, (so besides using lavender I can also use this as well)."
B002G789QC,J,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on September 25, 2017",,"I really love the smell of this scent - I'm a fan of citrus scents, and the citrus of this, combined with the bergamot and peach make it truly refreshing. It's also a classic scent, so it might also speak to the memory side of your brain!

This bottle gives a good amount. However, the neck of the bottle is so small that you can pretty much tip it upside down and nothing comes out. Applying it to the skin this way does not therefore give enough scent to last - I feel it stays for a few short hours. I find that decantering into an atomizer makes a difference, as you can spray more onto you over a larger area. The difficulty is that you can't simply pour the liquid from the bottle into the atomizer because the neck is so slim, so I've been siphoning it into the atomizer with an extremely slim straw (which is, unfortunately, shorter than the bottle, so I'm going to have to find another solution once I use up enough to make the remaining liquid unattainable..)."
B002G789QC,Koko E.,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 28, 2020",,"TLDR:

+ Amazing and refreshing scent, perfect for summers.
+ Great as an aftershave or for bed linen.
- Poor performance, but to be fair that's not what this is intended for.

I absolutely love this scent, reminds me of a barber shop for some reason. This is a light and sparkly neroli that's perfect for warmer weather, unfortunately this cologne concentration does not last long on my skin‚ÄîI get 30 minutes to an hour maximum, so I use this almost exclusively as an aftershave. Amazing scent though!

For those complaining, is not an EDT or EDP, it's a cologne splasher so don't expect long lasting performance from it‚Äîthat's not the point. If you want a similar neroli fragrance that lasts a bit longer, check out Tom Ford's Neroli Portofino."

B002G789QC,Emily,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on July 24, 2013",,"I bought a bottle of 4711 after discovering that it was very popular in the 1950s, which is my favourite decade. I highly recommend this product because I think the scent is a delightful, timeless classic. I would, however, try the scent before buying this product because it smells slightly different to what I imagined. I think it smells very citrusy and it has a sort of musty tang to it when it is first applied; the ,longer you leave it on, the nicer the scent becomes. It is strong when you first apply it but then becomes more subtle by the end of the day. This bottle of 4711 is extremely good value-I haven't seen it cheaper anywhere else; it also lasts a long time because I have been using it for months now and I still have lots left! the packaging is wonderful, it has a traditional and grand air to it and looks lovely on my shelf. I highly recommend this product."

One of the things she always had on her dressing table was a bottle of 4711. She would sprinkle drops onto her handkerchief and lightly splash on her face and neck. She always smelt refreshingly attractive. Although I do not use frilled cloth handkerchiefs, I love the crisp and fresh scent of this cologne. I splash this on my face and body after a shower. It gives me an active buzz and I really do feel refreshed. I love it and when using Google it brings back the memories of my grandmother."
B002G789QC,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 14, 2017",,"This is very similar to Tom Ford's gorgeous and very expensive Neroli Portofino. Even the bright blue of the bottle is the same! (And this came first, incidentally)

It doesn't have huge lasting power but the bottle will last for ages so I've found you can be pretty lavish and splash it on to build up the scent with worrying about using it too fast, especially given how cheap it is.

Highly recommend for a fresh clean smell!"

B001RVKJZ2,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2021",Delightful Fragrance,"I have all of the Aqua Colonia Fragrances and find them to be a wonderful change from the heavy blended colognes that all seem to smell overpowering. These are all great on their own, however they are light and easy to layer if you would like to try it. This one should be sprayed first, and it is a lovely fragrance on it's own or with the Mandarin orange or the peach, or lime spritzed on top. They are really fun to have and all smell terrific. This Lychee Mint one does seem to last longer. That's why spraying it first works out better. I have allergies and these all work for me. Also, some of the complaints that say they don't last long has to do with our own sensitivities to fragrance. After a while most of us will naturally adjust to certain fragrances we are wearing and no longer notice it and think its too light, or we need more. However others can really still smell them on us."

It was cheap enough, so I ordered it. Once I smelled it, I tossed it in the trash. I would say the scent is familiar, but not sure from where. The scent is not terrible, but I don't find it pleasant. I smelled my wrist a little while later to see if it would grow on me, and the smell wasn't even there. So not only doesn't it smell great, it doesn't last an hour. I would not recommend buying this unless you have smelled it in person. I was going to see if one of my family members wanted it, but I was actually so confident that nobody would like it that I tossed it."

B001RVKJZ2,MRS. THIBODEAUX,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2020",One of the Oldest Scents to come out of Germany,"Okay, this stuff is one of the oldest perfumes created in Cologne, Germany. Created, I believe, in 1872 and the scent seems that it would be pretty accurate for that time period. It is not, however, a modern scent. Its overpowering and if you're a frequent blind purchaser of perfumes or colognes and are familiar with the scent Natalie, designed by the family of actress Natalie Wood that was murdered in the prime of her amazing acting career. This is not a cologne to wear if you're sensitive to smells. If you just want to have it because of the age of the cologne (not original bottle or packaging) and just to say you have one of the oldest colognes to come out, then this will work for you."

I love the provenance behind the brand and have a very very old bottle of the original, but cannot use it as it brings on the al-mightiest of headaches, but this is a horse of a very different colour.

I've been complimented on it so much since too.
Good price point too. Def will buy it again.

To me its very feminine.

Nb: A week after using it, I have found that if you spray clothing with it, it tends to last. My nightgown still had the scent the following day. So a good 12hrs later, same with my hoody."
B07XTRNJ46,Chris Christopher,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on July 6, 2020",,"This is very simply a beautifully intoxicating and heady jasmine cologne. It takes your mind off straight away to the Mediterranean. No sooner had I shaved and splashed this on than I was a young boy again visiting my grandmother in Cyprus : she used to sit in the evenings by her front door under an arch of jasmine - the smell was absolutely heavenly as every now and again a little jasmine flower would fall off. This cologne is a bottle full of those little flowers. Imagine the sound of cicadas, an old, Byzantine church on the hill side silhouetted by the setting sun, a little taverna just about to get the evening rolling as a couple of cats lie blissfully asleep still on a couple of straw chairs and, like a mysterious ancient Greek god travelling between the shadows and flicker of the eyelid - you smell this jasmine pervading and riding upon every single air current that the evening avails to intoxicate and enchant your
soul. I will be buying this again."

What's lovely about this latest scent, one of several, is it has the distinctive scent but with the added charm of jasmine. It's not overly obvious and is all the better for the subtlety.

B003HLF5L8,flyingscot4,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2022",60 years and counting...,"I have used 4711 for over 60 years. When my TOD in Germany ended I bought the biggest bottle I could find and brought it back with me. At times it had been difficult to find and I used Guerlain L'Imperial when I couldn't find 4711. I don't think that the scent lasts as long as it did years ago (or maybe I just smell like an old man), but the scent has never changed. People do need to understand that Eau du Cologne is not the same as Eau du Toilette, which is twice as expensive and lasts a bit longer, but EDT is much too expensive to use as a splash. 4711 takes that title hands down!"
